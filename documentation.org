** StumpWM manual
Choose your version. These are generated from the source code and then
converted from the texinfo.  You can also compile the texinfo to an
info file and read it in emacs.  (This is done automatically during
the build process).  If you find something missing from the manual,
please add it by editing the =stumpwm.texi.in= in the git repo, or
open an issue on the issue tracker.
