1 Introduction
**************

StumpWM is an X11 window manager written entirely in Common Lisp.  Its
user interface goals are similar to ratpoison’s but with an emphasis on
customizability, completeness, and cushiness.

1.1 Starting StumpWM
====================

There are a number of ways to start StumpWM but the most straight
forward method is as follows.  This assumes you have a copy of the
StumpWM source code and are using the ‘SBCL’ Common Lisp environment.

  1. Install the prerequisites and build StumpWM as described in
     ‘README’.  This should give you a ‘stumpwm’ executable.

  2. In your ‘~/.xinitrc’ file include the line ‘/path/to/stumpwm’.
     Remember to replace ‘/path/to/’ with the actual path.

  3. Finally, start X windows with ‘startx’.  Cross your fingers.  You
     should see a ‘Welcome To the Stump Window Manager’ message pop up
     in the upper, right corner.  At this point, you have successfully
     started StumpWM.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Basic Usage,  Next: Interacting with the Lisp process,  Prev: Starting StumpWM,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Basic Usage
===============

Once you have StumpWM up and running, the first thing you might want to
do is start ‘emacs’.  Type ‘C-t e’, or in other words ‘Control + t’
followed by ‘e’.  Now perhaps you want an ‘xterm’.  Type ‘C-t c’.  Now
you have some programs running.

   To see a list of windows StumpWM is managing, type ‘C-t w’.  The
highlighted window is the one you’re looking at right now.  It’s the
focused window.

   All of StumpWM’s keys are bound to named commands, which can be
executed not only by keys but also from the input bar.  Type ‘C-t ;’ to
open a command prompt.  Now type ‘time’ and press return.  Note, ‘time’
can also be called by typing ‘C-t a’.  Throughout this manual you’ll
find definitions for commands, functions, and variables.  Any command
you see in this manual can be executed from the input bar or bound to a
key.

   At this point you probably want to switch back from your new ‘xterm’
to ‘emacs’.  Type ‘C-t C-t’.  This runs the ‘other’ command.  Type it
again and you’re back to xterm.

   Perhaps you’d like to see ‘emacs’ and ‘xterm’ side-by-side.  Type
‘C-t s’.  You have now split the screen into 2 ‘frames’.  For more
information see *note Frames::.  To switch to the empty frame type ‘C-t
TAB’.  Now let’s pull the xterm window into this empty frame.  Type ‘C-t
w’ for a window listing.  Find the ‘xterm’ window.  See the number
beside it?  Type ‘C-t’ followed by ‘xterm’’s window number.

   Another common activity is browsing the interwebs.  Type ‘C-t !’.
The input bar pops up again.  You can now run a shell command.  Let’s
start a web browser: type ‘firefox’ into the input bar and press return.

   Unfortunately, ‘firefox’ probably isn’t wide enough because it’s in
one of the frames.  Type ‘C-t Q’ to remove all frames but the current
one and resize it to fit the screen.

   For a full list of key bindings, see *note List of Default
Keybindings::.

1.3 Interacting with the Lisp process
=====================================

Since StumpWM is a Lisp program, there is a way for you to evaluate Lisp
code directly, on the same Lisp process that StumpWM is running on.
Type ‘C-t :’ and an input box will appear.  Then type some Lisp
expression.

   When you call ‘eval’ this way, you will be in the STUMPWM-USER
package, which imports all the exported symbols from the main STUMPWM
package.

‘*mode-line-border-width*’
     Reads the value of *MODE-LINE-BORDER-WIDTH*.

‘(setf *mode-line-border-width* 3)’
     Sets the variable *MODE-LINE-BORDER-WIDTH* to 3.

‘(set-prefix-key (kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))’
     Calls the ‘set-prefix-key’ function (and sets a new keyboard
     prefix)

2 Key Bindings
**************

StumpWM is controlled entirely by keystrokes and Lisp commands.  It
mimics GNU Screen’s keyboard handling.  StumpWM’s default prefix key is
‘C-t’.

* Modifiers::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: List of Default Keybindings,  Next: Binding Keys,  Prev: Key Bindings,  Up: Key Bindings

2.1 List of Default Keybindings
===============================

The following is a list of keybindings.

‘C-t D’
     Select the window with the corresponding digit D

‘C-t C-D’
     Pull the window with the corresponding digit D into the current
     frame

‘C-t n’
‘C-t C-n’
‘C-t Space’
     Go to the next window in the window list

‘C-t p’
‘C-t C-p’
     Go to the previous window in the window list

‘C-t '’
     Go to a window by name

‘C-t "’
     Select a window from a list and focus the window.

‘C-t C-g’
     Abort the current command.  This is useful if you accidentally hit
     ‘C-t’

‘C-t w’
     List all the windows

‘C-t i’
     Display information about the current window.

‘C-t f’
     Select a frame by number

‘C-t s’
     Split current frame vertically

‘C-t S’
     Split current frame horizontally

‘C-t k’
‘C-t C-k’
     Sends a kill message to the current frame and the running program.

‘C-t K’
     Kills the current frame and running program; like a ‘kill -9’.

‘C-t c’
‘C-t C-c’
     Run an X terminal; by default ‘xterm’

‘C-t e’
‘C-t C-e’
     Run Emacs or raise it if it is already running.

‘C-t t’
     Sends a ‘C-t’ to the frame; this is useful for applications like
     Firefox which make heavy use of ‘C-t’ (in Firefox’s case, for
     opening a new tab).  This is similar to how GNU screen uses ‘C-a
     a’.

‘C-t w’
‘C-t C-w’
     Prints out a list of the windows, their number, and their name.

‘C-t b’
‘C-t C-b’
     Banish the mouse point to the lower right corner of the screen.

‘C-t a’
‘C-t C-a’
     Display the current time and date, much like the Unix command
     ‘date’.

‘C-t C-t’
     Switch to the last window to have focus in the current frame.

‘C-t !’
     Prompt for a shell command to run via ‘/bin/sh’.  All output is
     discarded.

‘C-t R’
     If the screen is split into multiple frames, one split will be
     undone.  If there is only one split, the effect will be the same as
     ‘C-t Q’.

‘C-t o’
‘C-t TAB’
     If the screen is split into multiple frames, focus shifts to the
     ‘next’ frame, where it cycles to the right and then down; analogous
     to ‘C-x o’ in Emacs.

‘C-t F’
     Display “Current Frame” in the frame which has focus.

‘C-t ;’
     Opens the input box.  StumpWM commands can be run from here, and
     the input history moved through.

‘C-t :’
     Opens the input box, but all things typed in here will be sent to
     the Common Lisp interpreter where they will be ran as Lisp
     programs; thus, input should be valid Common Lisp.

‘C-t C-h’
‘C-t ?’
     The help.

‘C-t -’
     Hide all frames and show the root window.

‘C-t Q’
     Removes all splits and maximizes the frame with focus.

‘C-t Up’
‘C-t Down’
‘C-t Left’
‘C-t Right’
     Shift focus to an adjacent frame in the specified direction.  ‘C-t
     Up’ will shift focus up, if possible, ‘C-t Down’ will shift
     downwards, etc.

‘C-t v’
     Prints out the version of the running StumpWM.

‘C-t #’
     Toggle the mark on the current window

‘C-t m’
‘C-t C-m’
     Display the last message.  Hitting this keybinding again displays
     the message before that, and so on.

‘C-t l’
‘C-t C-l’
     redisplay the current window and force it to take up the entire
     frame.

‘C-t G’
     Display all groups and windows in each group.  For more information
     see *note Groups::.

‘C-t FN’
     Jump to the corresponding group N.  ‘C-t F1’ jumps to group 1 and
     so on.

‘C-t g g’
     Show the list of groups.

‘C-t g c’
     Create a new group.

‘C-t g n’
‘C-t g C-n’
‘C-t g SPC’
‘C-t g C-SPC’
     Go to the next group in the list.

‘C-t g N’
     Go to the next group in the list and bring the current window
     along.

‘C-t g p’
‘C-t g C-p’
     Go to the previous group in the list.

‘C-t g P’
     Go to the previous group in the list and bring the current window
     along.

‘C-t g '’
     Select a group by name or by number.

‘C-t g "’
     Select a group from a list and switch to it.

‘C-t g m’
     Move the current window to the specified group.

‘C-t g k’
     Kill the current group.  All windows are merged into the next
     group.

‘C-t g A’
‘C-t g r’
     Change the current group’s name.

‘C-t g D’
     Go to the group with digit D.  ‘C-t g 1’ jumps to group 1 and so
     on.

‘C-t +’
     Make frames the same height or width in the current frame’s
     subtree.

‘C-t h k’
     Describe the specified key binding.

‘C-t h f’
     Describe the specified function.

‘C-t h v’
     Describe the specified variable.

‘C-t h w’
     List all key sequences that are bound to the specified command

‘C-t h c’
     Describe the specified command.

2.2 Binding Keys
================

 -- Function: define-key map key command
     Add a keybinding mapping for the key, KEY, to the command, COMMAND,
     in the specified keymap.  If COMMAND is nil, remove an exising
     binding.  For example,

          (stumpwm:define-key stumpwm:*root-map* (stumpwm:kbd "C-z") "echo Zzzzz...")

     Now when you type C-t C-z, you’ll see the text “Zzzzz...” pop up.

 -- Function: undefine-key map key
     Clear the key binding in the specified keybinding.

 -- Function: kbd keys
     This compiles a key string into a key structure used by
     ‘define-key’, ‘undefine-key’, ‘set-prefix-key’ and others.

 -- Command: set-prefix-key key
     Change the stumpwm prefix key to KEY.
          (stumpwm:set-prefix-key (stumpwm:kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))

     This will change the prefix key to <Control> + <Meta> + <Hyper> +
     <Super> + the <z> key.  By most standards, a terrible prefix key
     but it makes a great example.

 -- Function: make-sparse-keymap
     Create an empty keymap.  If you want to create a new list of
     bindings in the key binding tree, this is where you start.  To hang
     frame related bindings off ‘C-t C-f’ one might use the following
     code:

          (defvar *my-frame-bindings*
            (let ((m (stumpwm:make-sparse-keymap)))
              (stumpwm:define-key m (stumpwm:kbd "f") "curframe")
              (stumpwm:define-key m (stumpwm:kbd "M-b") "move-focus left")
              m ; NOTE: this is important
            ))

          (stumpwm:define-key stumpwm:*root-map* (stumpwm:kbd "C-f") '*my-frame-bindings*)

 -- Variable: *root-map*
     This is the keymap by default bound to ‘C-t’.  It is known as the
     “prefix map”.

 -- Variable: *top-map*
     The top level key map.  This is where you’ll find the binding for
     the “prefix map”.

 -- Variable: *groups-map*
     The keymap that group related key bindings sit on.  It is bound to
     ‘C-t g’ by default.

 -- Command: bind key command
     Hang a key binding off the escape key.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Prev: Binding Keys,  Up: Key Bindings

2.3 Modifiers
=============

Many users have had some difficulty with setting up modifiers for
StumpWM keybindings.  This is caused by a combination of how StumpWM
handles modifiers and the default modifiers list for many users’ X
servers.

   • My “Super” key doesn’t work!

     This is most likely caused by having the Hyper and Super keys
     listed as the same modifier in the modifier list.

          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4        Super_L (0x7f),  Hyper_L (0x80)
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

     The problem is in the line beginning with “mod4”.  The way to set
     up the modifier list correctly is to have just the Super key as the
     mod4 modifier.  The following ‘xmodmap’ commands will do just that.

          # clear out the mod4 modifier
          $ xmodmap -e 'clear mod4'
          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

          # add Super as a mod4 modifier
          $ xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'
          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_L (0x7f)
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

     You can automate this by storing the commands in a file and calling
     xmodmap when you start your X session.

          $ cat ~/.Xmodmap
          clear mod4
          add mod4 = Super_L

     If you use ‘startx’, modify your ‘~/.xsession’ or ‘~/.xinitrc’
     file.

          $ cat ~/.xsession
          #!/bin/sh

          xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
          exec /usr/bin/stumpwm

     If you use a graphical login manager (GDM, KDM, etc.), your
     ‘~/.Xmodmap’ file should be fed to ‘xmodmap’ when you log in.
     FIXME: verify this.

   • Handling Meta and Alt: when do I use ‘M-’ and ‘A-’?

     If you have no Meta keys defined (see the output of the ‘xmodmap’
     command), then StumpWM will treat the ‘M-’ prefix in keybindings to
     mean Alt.  However, if there are Meta keys defined, then the ‘M-’
     prefix refers to them, and the ‘A-’ prefix refers to Alt.

     Most users will simply use ‘M-’ to refer to their Alt keys.
     However, users that define separate Meta and Alt keys will use ‘M-’
     to refer to the former, and ‘A-’ to refer to the latter.

   • How can I set up a Hyper key and use it with StumpWM?

     To set up a Hyper key, you need to do two things: bind a physical
     key to be a Hyper key, and add that key to the modifiers list.

     The following example shows how to bind the control key at the
     bottom-left of most keyboards to be Hyper.  This is useful if
     you’ve made Caps Lock into a control key, and have no use for the
     bottom-left key.

          $ xmodmap -e 'keycode 37 = Hyper_L'
          $ xmodmap -e 'clear mod5'
          $ xmodmap -e 'add mod5 = Hyper_L'

     To use a different key for Hyper, replace the keycode “37” above.
     Use the ‘xev’ program to see the keycode that any physical key has.
     Refer to the section above on setting up the Super key to see how
     to automate setting the Hyper key when you start X.

     Now you can use ‘H-’ as a prefix in StumpWM bindings.

          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-RET") "fullscreen")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Left") "gprev")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Right") "gnext")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-TAB") "other")

     Since essentially no programs have Hyper bindings, you can safely
     bind commands to the *TOP-MAP*.

4.3 Programming The Message Bar
===============================

 -- Function: echo-string screen msg
     Display STRING in the message bar on SCREEN.  You almost always
     want to use ‘message’.

 -- Function: message fmt &rest args
     run FMT and ARGS through ‘format’ and echo the result to the
     current screen.

 -- Variable: *input-history-ignore-duplicates*
     Do not add a command to the input history if it’s already the first
     in the list.

 -- Command: copy-last-message
     Copy the last message displayed into the X selection

4.4 Programming the Input Bar
=============================

New input behavior can be added to the input bar by creating editing
functions and binding them to keys in the *INPUT-MAP* using
‘define-key’, just like other key bindings.

   An input function takes 2 arguments: the input structure and the key
pressed.

 -- Function: read-one-line screen prompt &key (initial-input )
          require-match password
     Read a line of input through stumpwm and return it.  returns nil if
     the user aborted.

 -- Function: read-one-char screen
     Read a single character from the user.

 -- Function: completing-read screen prompt completions &key
          (initial-input ) require-match
     Read a line of input through stumpwm and return it with TAB
     completion.  completions can be a list, an fbound symbol, or a
     function.  if its an fbound symbol or a function then that function
     is passed the substring to complete on and is expected to return a
     list of matches.  If require-match argument is non-nil then the
     input must match with an element of the completions.

 -- Function: input-insert-string input string
     Insert STRING into the input at the current position.  INPUT must
     be of type INPUT-LINE.  Input functions are passed this structure
     as their first argument.

 -- Function: input-insert-char input char
     Insert CHAR into the input at the current position.  INPUT must be
     of type INPUT-LINE.  Input functions are passed this structure as
     their first argument.

 -- Variable: *input-map*
     This is the keymap containing all input editing key bindings.

5.2 Customizing Window Appearance
=================================

 -- Variable: *maxsize-border-width*
     The width in pixels given to the borders of windows with maxsize or
     ratio hints.

 -- Variable: *transient-border-width*
     The width in pixels given to the borders of transient or pop-up
     windows.

 -- Variable: *normal-border-width*
     The width in pixels given to the borders of regular windows.

 -- Variable: *window-border-style*
     This controls the appearance of the border around windows.  valid
     values are:
     :THICK
          All space within the frame not used by the window is dedicated
          to the border.

     :THIN
          Only the border width as controlled by *maxsize-border-width*
          *normal-border-width* and *transient-border-width* is used as
          the border.  The rest is filled with the unfocus color.

     :TIGHT
          The same as :thin but the border surrounds the window and the
          wasted space within the frame is not obscured, revealing the
          background.

     :NONE
          Like :tight but no border is ever visible.

     After changing this variable you may need to call
     sync-all-frame-windows to see the change.

 -- Function: set-win-bg-color color

File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Controlling Raise And Map Requests,  Next: Programming With Windows,  Prev: Customizing Window Appearance,  Up: Windows

5.3 Controlling Raise And Map Requests
======================================

It is sometimes handy to deny a window’s request to be focused.  The
following variables determine such behavior.

   A map request occurs when a new or withdrawn window requests to be
mapped for the first time.

   A raise request occurs when a client asks the window manager to give
an existing window focus.

 -- Variable: *deny-map-request*
     A list of window properties that stumpwm should deny matching
     windows’ requests to become mapped for the first time.

 -- Variable: *deny-raise-request*
     Exactly the same as *DENY-MAP-REQUEST* but for raise requests.

     Note that no denial message is displayed if the window is already
     visible.

 -- Variable: *suppress-deny-messages*
     For complete focus on the task at hand, set this to ‘T’ and no
     raise/map denial messages will be seen.

   Some examples follow.

     ;; Deny the firefox window from taking focus when clicked upon.
     (push '(:class "gecko") stumpwm:*deny-raise-request*)

     ;; Deny all map requests
     (setf stumpwm:*deny-map-request* t)

     ;; Deny transient raise requests
     (push '(:transient) stumpwm:*deny-map-request*)

     ;; Deny the all windows in the xterm class from taking focus.
     (push '(:class "Xterm") stumpwm:*deny-raise-request*)

     The name given to a window that does not supply its own name.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Rule Based Window Placement,  Prev: Programming With Windows,  Up: Windows

5.5 Rule Based Window Placement
===============================

 -- Macro: define-frame-preference target-group &rest frame-rules
     Create a rule that matches windows and automatically places them in
     a specified group and frame.  Each frame rule is a lambda list:
          (frame-number raise lock &key create restore dump-name class instance type role title)

     FRAME-NUMBER
          The frame number to send matching windows to

     RAISE
          When non-nil, raise and focus the window in its frame

     LOCK
          When this is nil, this rule will only match when the current
          group matches TARGET-GROUP.  When non-nil, this rule matches
          regardless of the group and the window is sent to
          TARGET-GROUP.  If LOCK and RAISE are both non-nil, then
          stumpwm will jump to the specified group and focus the matched
          window.

     CREATE
          When non-NIL the group is created and eventually restored when
          the value of create is a group dump filename in *DATA-DIR*.
          Defaults to NIL.

     RESTORE
          When non-NIL the group is restored even if it already exists.
          This arg should be set to the dump filename to use for forced
          restore.  Defaults to NIL

     CLASS
          The window’s class must match CLASS.

     INSTANCE
          The window’s instance/resource name must match INSTANCE.

     TYPE
          The window’s type must match TYPE.

     ROLE
          The window’s role must match ROLE.

     TITLE
          The window’s title must match TITLE.

 -- Function: clear-window-placement-rules
     Clear all window placement rules.

 -- Command: remember lock title
     Make a generic placement rule for the current window.  Might be too
     specific/not specific enough!

 -- Command: forget
     Forget the window placement rule that matches the current window.

 -- Command: dump-window-placement-rules file
     Dump *window-placement-rules* to FILE.

 -- Command: restore-window-placement-rules file
     Restore *window-placement-rules* from FILE.

7 The Mode Line
***************

The mode line is a bar that runs across either the top or bottom of a
head and is used to display information.  By default the mode line
displays the list of windows, similar to the output ‘C-t w’ produces.

   Alternatively, external panel applications such as the GNOME panel
and KDE’s kicker may be used.  Simply starting one of these programs is
enough to set it as the mode line of the head it would like to be on (if
the panel is Xinerama aware) or whichever head is available.  In order
to avoid problems displaying menus, configure your panel application for
positioning at the top or bottom of the head rather than relying on
*MODE-LINE-POSITION*

   The mode line can be turned on and off with the ‘mode-line’ command
or the lisp function ‘stumpwm:toggle-mode-line’.  Each head has its own
mode line.  For example:

     ;; turn on/off the mode line for the current head only.
     (stumpwm:toggle-mode-line (stumpwm:current-screen)
                               (stumpwm:current-head))

   The mode line is updated after every StumpWM command.

   To display the window list and the current date on the modeline, one
might do the following:

     (setf stumpwm:*screen-mode-line-format*
           (list "%w | "
                 '(:eval (stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t))))

   ‘(stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t)’ runs the command ‘date’ and
returns its output as a string.

 -- Command: mode-line
     A command to toggle the mode line visibility.

 -- Function: toggle-mode-line screen head &optional (format (quote
          *screen-mode-line-format*))
     Toggle the state of the mode line for the specified screen

 -- Variable: *screen-mode-line-format*
     This variable describes what will be displayed on the modeline for
     each screen.  Turn it on with the function TOGGLE-MODE-LINE or the
     mode-line command.

     It is a list where each element may be a string, a symbol, or a
     list.

     For a symbol its value is used.

     For a list of the form (:eval FORM) FORM is evaluated and the
     result is used as a mode line element.

     If it is a string the string is printed with the following
     formatting options:

     %h
          List the number of the head the mode-line belongs to

     %w
          List all windows in the current group windows using
          *WINDOW-FORMAT*

     %W
          List all windows on the current head of the current group
          using *WINDOW-FORMAT*

     %g
          List the groups using *GROUP-FORMAT*

   The following variables control the color, position, and size of the
mode line.

 -- Variable: *mode-line-position*
     Specifies where the mode line is displayed.  Valid values are :top
     and :bottom.

 -- Variable: *mode-line-border-width* 1
     nil

 -- Variable: *mode-line-pad-x*

 -- Variable: *mode-line-foreground-color*
     nil

 -- Variable: *mode-line-border-color*
     nil

 -- Variable: *mode-line-timeout*
     The modeline updates after each command, when a new window appears
     or an existing one disappears, and on a timer.  This variable
     controls how many seconds elapse between each update.  If this
     variable is changed while the modeline is visible, you must toggle
     the modeline to update timer.

8 Groups
********

Groups in StumpWM are more commonly known as “virtual desktops” or
“workspaces”.  Why not create a new term for it?

 -- Command: gnew name
     Create a new group with the specified name.  The new group becomes
     the current group.  If NAME begins with a dot (“.”) the group new
     group will be created in the hidden state.  Hidden groups have
     group numbers less than one and are invisible to from gprev, gnext,
     and, optionally, groups and vgroups commands.

 -- Command: gnew-float name
     Create a floating window group with the specified name and switch
     to it.

 -- Command: gnewbg name
     Create a new group but do not switch to it.

 -- Command: gnewbg-float name
     Create a floating window group with the specified name, but do not
     switch to it.

 -- Command: gnext
     Cycle to the next group in the group list.

 -- Command: gprev
     Cycle to the previous group in the group list.

 -- Command: gnext-with-window
     Cycle to the next group in the group list, taking the current
     window along.

 -- Command: gprev-with-window
     Cycle to the previous group in the group list, taking the current
     window along.

 -- Command: gother
     Go back to the last group.

 -- Command: gmerge from
     Merge FROM into the current group.  FROM is not deleted.

 -- Command: groups &optional (fmt *group-format*)
     Display the list of groups with their number and name.
     *GROUP-FORMAT* controls the formatting.  The optional argument FMT
     can be used to override the default group formatting.

 -- Command: vgroups &optional gfmt wfmt
     Like ‘groups’ but also display the windows in each group.  The
     optional arguments GFMT and WFMT can be used to override the
     default group formatting and window formatting, respectively.

 -- Command: gselect to-group
     Select the first group that starts with SUBSTRING.  SUBSTRING can
     also be a number, in which case ‘gselect’ selects the group with
     that number.

 -- Command: gmove to-group
     Move the current window to the specified group.

 -- Command: gkill
     Kill the current group.  All windows in the current group are
     migrated to the next group.

 -- Command: grename name
     Rename the current group.

 -- Command: grouplist &optional (fmt *group-format*)
     Allow the user to select a group from a list, like windowlist but
     for groups

8.1 Customizing Groups
======================

 -- Variable: *group-formatters*
     An alist of characters and formatter functions.  The character can
     be used as a format character in *GROUP-FORMAT*.  When the
     character is encountered in the string, the corresponding function
     is called with a group as an argument.  The functions return value
     is inserted into the string.  If the return value isn’t a string it
     is converted to one using ‘prin1-to-string’.

 -- Variable: *group-format*
     The format string that decides what information will show up in the
     group listing.  The following format options are available:

     %n
          Substitutes the group number translated via
          *group-number-map*, if there are more windows than
          *group-number-map* then will use the group-number.

     %s
          The group’s status.  Similar to a window’s status.

     %t
          The group’s name.

 -- Function: current-group &optional (screen (current-screen))
     Return the current group for the current screen, unless otherwise
     specified.

9.1 Xinerama
============

StumpWM will attempt to detect Xinerama heads at startup (and at no
other time.)  Heads are logically contained by screens.  In a
dual-monitor Xinerama configuration, there will be one screen with two
heads.  Non-rectangular layouts are supported (frames will not be
created in the ’dead zone’.)  And message windows will be displayed on
the current head–that is, the head to which the currently focused frame
belongs.

10 Interacting With Unix
************************

 -- Command: run-shell-command cmd &optional collect-output-p
     Run the specified shell command.  If COLLECT-OUTPUT-P is ‘T’ then
     run the command synchonously and collect the output.  Be careful.
     If the shell command doesn’t return, it will hang StumpWM. In such
     a case, kill the shell command to resume StumpWM.

 -- Function: programs-in-path &optional full-path (path (split-string
          (getenv PATH) :))
     Return a list of programs in the path.  if FULL-PATH is T then
     return the full path, otherwise just return the filename.  PATH is
     by default the ‘PATH’ evironment variable but can be specified.  It
     should be a string containing each directory seperated by a colon.

 -- Function: pathname-is-executable-p pathname
     Return T if the pathname describes an executable file.

 -- Variable: *shell-program*
     The shell program used by ‘run-shell-command’.

 -- Function: getenv var
     Return the value of the environment variable.

12 Miscellaneous Commands
*************************

The following is a list of commands that don’t really fit in any other
section.

 -- Command: emacs
     Start emacs unless it is already running, in which case focus it.

 -- Command: banish &optional where
     Warp the mouse the lower right corner of the current head.

 -- Command: ratwarp x y
     Warp the mouse to the specified location.

 -- Command: ratrelwarp dx dy
     Warp the mouse by the specified amount from its current position.

 -- Command: ratclick &optional (button 1)
     Simulate a pointer button event at the current pointer location.
     Note: this function is unlikely to work unless your X server and
     CLX implementation support XTEST.

 -- Command: echo-date
     Display the date and time.

 -- Command: eval-line cmd
     Evaluate the s-expression and display the result(s).

 -- Command: window-send-string string &optional (window
          (current-window))
     Send the string of characters to the current window as if they’d
     been typed.

 -- Command: reload
     Reload StumpWM using ‘asdf’.

 -- Command: loadrc
     Reload the ‘~/.stumpwmrc’ file.

 -- Command: keyboard-quit

 -- Command: quit
     Quit StumpWM.

 -- Command: restart-hard
     Restart stumpwm.  This is handy if a new stumpwm executable has
     been made and you wish to replace the existing process with it.

     Any run-time customizations will be lost after the restart.

 -- Command: restart-soft
     Soft Restart StumpWM. The lisp process isn’t restarted.  Instead,
     control jumps to the very beginning of the stumpwm program.  This
     differs from RESTART, which restarts the unix process.

     Since the process isn’t restarted, existing customizations remain
     after the restart.

 -- Command: getsel
     Echo the X selection.

 -- Command: putsel string
     Stuff the string STRING into the X selection.

 -- Command: command-mode
     Command mode allows you to type ratpoison commands without needing
     the <C-t> prefix.  Keys not bound in StumpWM will still get sent to
     the current window.  To exit command mode, type <C-g>.

 -- Command: copy-unhandled-error
     When an unhandled error occurs, StumpWM restarts and attempts to
     continue.  Unhandled errors should be reported to the mailing list
     so they can be fixed.  Use this command to copy the unhandled error
     and backtrace to the X11 selection so you can paste in your email
     when submitting the bug report.

 -- Command: commands
     List all available commands.

 -- Command: lastmsg
     Display the last message.  If the previous command was lastmsg,
     then continue cycling back through the message history.

 -- Command: list-window-properties
     List all the properties of the current window and their values,
     like xprop.

 -- Function: run-commands &rest commands
     Run each stumpwm command in sequence.  This could be used if you’re
     used to ratpoison’s rc file and you just want to run commands or
     don’t know lisp very well.  One might put the following in one’s rc
     file:

          (stumpwm:run-commands
            "escape C-z"
            "exec firefox"
            "split")

 -- Macro: defcommand name (&rest args) (&rest interactive-args) &body
          body
     Create a command function and store its interactive hints in
     *command-hash*.  The local variable %interactivep% can be used to
     check if the command was called interactively.  If it is non-NIL
     then it was called from a keybinding or from the colon command.

     INTERACTIVE-ARGS is a list of the following form: ((TYPE PROMPT)
     (TYPE PROMPT) ...)

     each element in INTERACTIVE-ARGS declares the type and prompt for
     the command’s arguments.

     TYPE can be one of the following:

     :Y-OR-N
          A yes or no question returning T or NIL.
     :VARIABLE
          A lisp variable
     :FUNCTION
          A lisp function
     :COMMAND
          A stumpwm command as a string.
     :KEY-SEQ
          A key sequence starting from *TOP-MAP*
     :WINDOW-NUMBER
          An existing window number
     :NUMBER
          An integer number
     :STRING
          A string
     :KEY
          A single key chord
     :WINDOW-NAME
          An existing window’s name
     :DIRECTION
          A direction symbol.  One of :UP :DOWN :LEFT :RIGHT
     :GRAVITY
          A gravity symbol.  One of :center :top :right :bottom :left
          :top-right :top-left :bottom-right :bottom-left
     :GROUP
          An existing group
     :FRAME
          A frame
     :SHELL
          A shell command
     :REST
          The rest of the input yes to be parsed.
     :MODULE
          An existing stumpwm module

     Note that new argument types can be created with
     DEFINE-STUMPWM-TYPE.

     PROMPT can be string.  In this case, if the corresponding argument
     is missing from an interactive call, stumpwm will use prompt for
     its value using PROMPT. If PROMPT is missing or nil, then the
     argument is considered an optional interactive argument and is not
     prompted for when missing.

     Alternatively, instead of specifying nil for PROMPT or leaving it
     out, an element can just be the argument type.

 -- Macro: define-stumpwm-type type (input prompt) &body body
     Create a new type that can be used for command arguments.  TYPE can
     be any symbol.

     When BODY is evaluated INPUT is bound to the argument-line.  It is
     passed to ‘argument-pop’, ‘argument-pop-rest’, etc.  PROMPT is the
     prompt that should be used when prompting the user for the
     argument.

          (define-stumpwm-type :symbol (input prompt)
           (or (find-symbol (string-upcase
          		     (or (argument-pop input)
                                   ;; Whitespace messes up find-symbol.
          		         (string-trim " "
          		           (completing-read (current-screen)
          					  prompt
          					  ;; find all symbols in the
          					  ;;  stumpwm package.
          					  (let (acc)
          					    (do-symbols (s (find-package "STUMPWM"))
          					      (push (string-downcase (symbol-name s)) acc))
          					    acc)))
                                (throw 'error "Abort.")))
                            "STUMPWM")
               (throw 'error "Symbol not in STUMPWM package")))

          (defcommand "symbol" (sym) ((:symbol "Pick a symbol: "))
            (message "~a" (with-output-to-string (s)
          	          (describe sym s))))

     This code creates a new type called ‘:symbol’ which finds the
     symbol in the stumpwm package.  The command ‘symbol’ uses it and
     then describes the symbol.

 -- Function: run-or-raise cmd props &optional (all-groups
          *run-or-raise-all-groups*) (all-screens
          *run-or-raise-all-screens*)
     Run the shell command, CMD, unless an existing window matches
     PROPS.  PROPS is a property list with the following keys:

     ‘:class’
          Match the window’s class.
     ‘:instance’
          Match the window’s instance or resource-name.
     ‘:role’
          Match the window’s ‘WM_WINDOW_ROLE’.
     ‘:title’
          Match the window’s title.

     By default, the global *RUN-OR-RAISE-ALL-GROUPS* decides whether to
     search all groups or the current one for a running instance.
     ALL-GROUPS overrides this default.  Similarily for
     *RUN-OR-RAISE-ALL-SCREENS* and ALL-SCREENS.

 -- Function: run-or-pull cmd props &optional (all-groups
          *run-or-raise-all-groups*) (all-screens
          *run-or-raise-all-screens*)
     Similar to run-or-raise, but move the matching window to the
     current frame instead of switching to the window.

 -- Variable: *run-or-raise-all-groups*
     When this is ‘T’ the ‘run-or-raise’ function searches all groups
     for a running instance.  Set it to NIL to search only the current
     group.

 -- Variable: *run-or-raise-all-screens*
     When this is ‘T’ the ‘run-or-raise’ function searches all screens
     for a running instance.  Set it to ‘NIL’ to search only the current
     screen.  If *RUN-OR-RAISE-ALL-GROUPS* is ‘NIL’ this variable has no
     effect.

 -- Function: restarts-menu err
     Display a menu with the active restarts and let the user pick one.
     Error is the error being recovered from.  If the user aborts the
     menu, the error is re-signalled.

 -- Macro: with-restarts-menu &body body
     Execute BODY. If an error occurs allow the user to pick a restart
     from a menu of possible restarts.  If a restart is not chosen,
     resignal the error.

 -- Variable: *startup-message*
     This is the message StumpWM displays when it starts.  Set it to NIL
     to suppress.

 -- Variable: *suppress-abort-messages*
     Suppress abort message when non-nil.

 -- Variable: *default-package*
     This is the package eval reads and executes in.  You might want to
     set this to ‘:stumpwm’ if you find yourself using a lot of internal
     stumpwm symbols.  Setting this variable anywhere but in your rc
     file will have no effect.

 -- Macro: defprogram-shortcut name &key (command (string-downcase
          (string name))) (props (quasiquote (quote (class #S(comma
          :expr (string-capitalize command) :kind 0))))) (map *top-map*)
          (key (kbd (concat H- (subseq command 0 1)))) (pullp nil)
          (pull-name (intern1 (concat (string name) -PULL))) (pull-key
          (kbd (concat H-M- (subseq command 0 1))))
     Define a command and key binding to run or raise a program.  If
     PULLP is set, also define a command and key binding to run or pull
     the program.

 -- Variable: *initializing*
     True when starting stumpwm.  Use this variable in your rc file to
     run code that should only be executed once, when stumpwm starts up
     and loads the rc file.

12.2 StumpWM’s Data Directory
=============================

If you want to store StumpWM data between sessions, the recommended
method is to store them in ‘~/.stumpwm.d/’.  StumpWM supplies some
functions to make doing this easier.

 -- Variable: *data-dir*
     The directory used by stumpwm to store data between sessions.

 -- Function: data-dir-file name &optional type
     Return a pathname inside stumpwm’s data dir with the specified name
     and type

 -- Macro: with-data-file (s file &rest keys &key (if-exists supersede)
          &allow-other-keys) &body body
     Open a file in StumpWM’s data directory.  keyword arguments are
     sent directly to OPEN. Note that IF-EXISTS defaults to :supersede,
     instead of :error.

12.3 Debugging StumpWM
======================

 -- Variable: *debug-level*
     Set this variable to a number > 0 to turn on debugging.  The
     greater the number the more debugging output.

 -- Variable: *debug-stream*
     This is the stream debugging output is sent to.  It defaults to
     *error-output*.  It may be more convenient for you to pipe
     debugging output directly to a file.

 -- Function: redirect-all-output file
     Elect to redirect all output to the specified file.  For instance,
     if you want everything to go to ~/stumpwm.d/debug-output.txt you
     would do:

          (redirect-all-output (data-dir-file "debug-output" "txt"))

 -- Function: run-with-timer secs repeat function &rest args
     Perform an action after a delay of SECS seconds.  Repeat the action
     every REPEAT seconds, if repeat is non-nil.  SECS and REPEAT may be
     reals.  The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.

 -- Function: cancel-timer timer
     Remove TIMER from the list of active timers.

 -- Function: timer-p TIMER
     Return T if TIMER is a timer structure.

13 Colors
*********

All text printed by stumpwm is run through a coloring engine before
being displayed.  All color commands start with a ‘^’ (caret) character
and apply to all text after it.

‘^0-9’
     A caret followed by a single digit number changes the foreground
     color to the specified color.  A ‘*’ can be used to specify the
     normal color.  See the color listing below.

‘^0-90-9’
     A caret followed by two digits sets the foreground and background
     color.  The first digit refers to the foreground color and the
     second digit to the background color.  A ‘*’ can be used in place
     of either digit to specify the normal color.  See the color listing
     below.

‘^B’
     Turn on bright colors.

‘^b’
     Turn off bright colors.

‘^n’
     Use the normal background and foreground color.

‘^R’
     Reverse the foreground and background colors.

‘^r’
     Turn off reverse colors.

‘^[’
     Push the current colors onto the color stack.  The current colors
     remain unchanged.

‘^]’
     Pop the colors off the color stack.

‘^^’
     Print a regular caret.

   The default colors are made to resemble the 16 VGA colors and are:
0 black
1 red
2 green
3 yellow
4 blue
5 magenta
6 cyan
7 white

   There are only 8 colors by default but 10 available digits.  The last
two digits are left up to the user.  *note Behind The Scenes Look At
Colors:: for information on customizing colors.

* Menu:

* Behind The Scenes Look At Colors::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Behind The Scenes Look At Colors,  Prev: Colors,  Up: Colors

13.1 Behind The Scenes Look At Colors
=====================================

Color indexes are stored in *COLORS* as a list.  The default list of
colors leave 2 slots for the user to choose.  If you’d like to use
‘Papaya Whip’ and ‘Dark Golden Rod 3’ you might eval the following:

     (setf *colors* (append *colors*
                            (list "PapayaWhip"
                                  "DarkGoldenRod3")))
     (update-color-map (current-screen))

   Of course, you can change all the colors if you like.

 -- Function: parse-color-string string
     parse a color coded string into a list of strings and color codes

 -- Function: uncolorify string
     Remove any color markup in STRING

 -- Variable: *colors*
     Eight colors by default.  You can redefine these to whatever you
     like and then call (update-color-map).

 -- Function: update-color-map screen
     Read *colors* and cache their pixel colors for use when rendering
     colored text.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Modules,  Prev: Colors,  Up: Top

14 Hooks
********

StumpWM exports a number of hooks you can use to add customizations;
like hooks in Emacs, you add to a hook with the ‘add-hook’ function.
for example:

     (stumpwm:add-hook 'stumpwm:*new-window-hook* 'my-new-window-custos)

   adds your ‘my-new-window-custos’ function to the list of functions
called when a new window appears.

 -- Macro: add-hook hook fn
     Add FUNCTION to the hook HOOK-VARIABLE.  For example, to display a
     message whenever you switch frames:

          (defun my-rad-fn (to-frame from-frame)
            (stumpwm:message "Mustard!"))

          (stumpmwm:add-hook stumpwm:*focus-frame-hook* 'my-rad-fn)

 -- Macro: remove-hook hook fn
     Remove the specified function from the hook.

   The following hooks are available:

 -- Hook: *new-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is added to the window list.  This
     includes a genuinely new window as well as bringing a withdrawn
     window back into the window list.

 -- Hook: *destroy-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is destroyed or withdrawn.

 -- Hook: *focus-window-hook*
     A hook called when a window is given focus.  It is called with 2
     arguments: the current window and the last window (could be nil).

 -- Hook: *place-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is placed by rule.  Arguments are
     window group and frame

 -- Hook: *start-hook*
     A hook called when stumpwm starts.

 -- Hook: *internal-loop-hook*
     A hook called inside stumpwm’s inner loop.

 -- Hook: *focus-frame-hook*
     A hook called when a frame is given focus.  The hook functions are
     called with 2 arguments: the current frame and the last frame.

 -- Hook: *new-frame-hook*
     A hook called when a new frame is created.  the hook is called with
     the frame as an argument.

 -- Hook: *message-hook*
     A hook called whenever stumpwm displays a message.  The hook
     function is passed any number of arguments.  Each argument is a
     line of text.

 -- Hook: *top-level-error-hook*
     Called when a top level error occurs.  Note that this hook is run
     before the error is dealt with according to
     *top-level-error-action*.

 -- Hook: *focus-group-hook*
     A hook called whenever stumpwm switches groups.  It is called with
     2 arguments: the current group and the last group.

 -- Hook: *key-press-hook*
     A hook called whenever a key under *top-map* is pressed.  It is
     called with 3 argument: the key, the (possibly incomplete) key
     sequence it is a part of, and command value bound to the key.

 -- Hook: *root-click-hook*
     A hook called whenever there is a mouse click on the root window.
     Called with 4 arguments, the screen containing the root window, the
     button clicked, and the x and y of the pointer.

 -- Hook: *mode-line-click-hook*
     Called whenever the mode-line is clicked.  It is called with 4
     arguments, the mode-line, the button clicked, and the x and y of
     the pointer.

 -- Hook: *urgent-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window sets the property indicating that
     it demands the user’s attention

 -- Hook: *event-processing-hook*
     A hook called inside stumpwm’s inner loop, before the default event
     processing takes place.  This hook is run inside (with-event-queue
     ...).

File: stumpwm.info,  Node: General Advice,  Next: Using git with StumpWM,  Prev: Hacking,  Up: Hacking

16.1 Hacking: General Advice
============================

  1. Pay attention to file names and contents.  If you’re making changes
     to mode-line related code, don’t put it in ‘core.lisp’.  If you’re
     introducing some completely new featureset, consider putting all of
     the new code in a new file.

  2. Does a command need to be user-visible (“interactive”) or is it
     just called by other commands?

        • If it’s not going to be user-visible, you can just use the
          familiar ‘(defun foo () ...)’ syntax.

        • If you want the command to be used interactively, you use
          StumpWM’s ‘defcommand’ syntax, as in the examples below.

               (defcommand test (foo bar)
                  ((:string "How you're going to prompt for variable foo: ")
                   (:number "How you want to prompt for variable bar: "))
                  "This command is a test"
                  (body...))

               (defcommand test2 () ()
                  "This is also a test"
                  (body...))

               (defcommand title (args) (interactive-args)
                  "Doc string"
                  (body...))

          So basically, inside the first set of parentheses after the
          function name, you specify what (if any) arguments will be
          passed to the command.  The second set of parentheses tells
          StumpWM how to get those arguments if they’re not explicitly
          passed to the command.  For example,

               ((:string "What do you want to do: "))

          will read a string from the input the user provides.  The
          quoted text is the prompt the user will see.  Of course, if
          you were to, say, call the command test, as defined above,
          from another piece of code, it wouldn’t give the prompt as
          long as you fed it arguments.

  3. Note that all commands defined using the ‘defcommand’ syntax are
     available both to be called with ‘C-t ;’ and from within other lisp
     programs, as though they had been defun-ned (which, in fact, they
     have).

  4. Any code that depends on external libraries or programs that some
     users might not have installed should be placed in the ‘contrib/’
     directory.

  5. Don’t be afraid to submit your patches to the StumpWM mailing list!
     It may not immediately make it into the official git repository,
     but individual users might find it useful and apply it to their own
     setup, or might be willing to offer suggestions on how to improve
     the code.

  6. Remember: StumpWM is designed to run on both clisp and on SBCL. If
     you must use code specific to one or the other, at the very least
     warn people that it only works with one lisp implementation.
     Better yet, figure out how to do it in the other distribution and
     write a statement like this:

          #+clisp
          (your-clisp-code)
          #+sbcl
          (your-sbcl-code)

     #to wrap the code for each lisp.  Of course, the best option is to
     find a way to use the same code for clisp and SBCL.

16.2 Hacking: Using git with StumpWM
====================================

For quite a while now, StumpWM has been using the git version control
system for development.  If you’re one using one of the official
releases or still using the now-obsolete CVS version, you can get the
bleeding-edge source code from the official git repository with a single
command:

     $ git clone git@github.com:sabetts/stumpwm.git

   After this, you’ll have a complete git repository, along with the
complete revision history since the switch.  Feel free to play around;
git has some important features that actually make this safe!

   Before we get to that stuff, though, you’re going to want to tell git
about yourself so that your information is included in your commits and
patches.  The very minimum you’re going to want to do is:

     $ git config --global user.name "Anne N. O'Nymous"
     $ git config --global user.email "anonymous@foo.org"

   Be sure to check out the manual for ‘git-config’–there are several
options you might want to set, such as enabling colorized output or
changing the editor and pager you use when making commits and viewing
logs.

   For the sake of argument, let’s say you want to make some major
changes to both ‘user.lisp’ and ‘core.lisp’, add a file called
‘DANGEROUS_EXPERIMENT_DO_NOT_USE_OR_ELSE.lisp’, and remove the manual
because you’re too 1337 for such things.  However, you don’t want to
break your entire StumpWM setup and start over.  Thankfully, you don’t
have to.  Before you get started, issue this command from the stumpwm
directory:

     $ git checkout -b experimental

   You should now find yourself in a new branch, called experimental.
To confirm this, type ‘git branch’; there should be an asterisk next to
the branch you’re currently viewing.  At any time, you can type ‘git
checkout master’ to return to your master branch, and at any time you
can have as many branches of the project as you like.  If you want to
create a new branch based not on the master branch but on your
experimental branch, for example, you’d type:

     $ git checkout -b new-experiment experimental

   This will place you in a newly-created branch called “new-experiment”
which should be identical to your experimental branch as of the last
commit (more on that soon).  If you’re actually typing out the
directions, switch back to your old experimental branch like so:

     $ git checkout experimental

   Anyway, now that you have a new branch, create that new file with the
long name, which I’ll just call ‘danger.lisp’ for brevity.  Make
whatever changes you want to it, and when you’re done, tell git about
your new file.

     $ git add dangerous.lisp

   Now, let’s pretend you’re done making changes.  Tell git you’re done
for now:

     $ git commit -a

   This will open up a prompt in your editor of choice for you to
describe your changes.  Try to keep the first line short, and then add
more explanation underneath (for an example, run the command ‘git log’
and take a look at some of the longer commit explanations).  Save that
file and then do this:

     $ git checkout master
     $ ls

   Then look for your new file.  It’s not there!  That’s because you’ve
done all of your work in another branch, which git is currently hiding
from you so that you can “check out” the branch called “master.” All is
as it should be–your master repository is still safe.

     $ git checkout experimental

   Now, delete ‘manual.lisp’ and ‘stumpwm.texi’.  That’s right.  Wipe
them off the face of the Earth, or at least off the hard drive of your
computer.  When you’re done, you don’t have to tell git you’ve deleted
them; it’ll figure it out on its own (though things may not compile
properly unless you edit ‘Makefile.in’ and ‘stumpwm.asd’.  Anyway, go
ahead and edit ‘core.lisp’ and ‘user.lisp’.  Really break ’em.  Run
free!  When you’re done, do another commit, as above, and give it a
stupid title like “lolz i b0rked stUmpwm guys wTF!?!?!!111!” Now try to
compile.  Just try.  It won’t work.  If it does, you’re some kind of
savant or something.  Keep up the good work.  If you’ve actually managed
to break StumpWM like you were supposed to, never fear!  You have two
options at this point.

   One is to go back to the master branch (with another git checkout)
and just delete your experimental branch, like so:

     $ git branch -D

   The “‘-D’” means to force a delete, even if the changes you’ve made
aren’t available elsewhere.  A “‘-d’” means to delete the branch if and
only if you’ve merged the changes in elsewhere.

   The other option is to create patches for each of your commits so
far, delete the branch, and then apply any working/wanted patches in a
new branch.  Create your patches (after committing) like so:

     $ git format-patch -o patches origin

   (Before doing that you can review your changes with ‘git log
origin..’)

   You can also use the ‘format-patch’ command to create a patch of
working code to send in to the mailing list.

   A developer might ask you to try out something they’re working on.
To fetch their master branch, you’d do this:

     $ git remote add -f -m master -t master foo git://bar.org/~foo/stumpwm

   Here, “foo” is the shorthand name you’ll use to refer to that
repository in the future.  To checkout a local copy of that repository,
you’d then do

     $ git checkout --track -b foo-master foo/master

   Later you could use ‘git pull foo’ to update while looking at that
branch (and note that ‘git pull’ with no arguments, in the master
branch, will update your StumpWM from the official repository).

   Finally, if you want to move your experimental changes into your
master branch, you’d checkout your master branch and run:

     $ git merge experimental

   If there are file conflicts, ‘git diff’ will show you where they are;
you have to fix them by hand.  When you’re done, do another

     $ git commit -a

   to finalize the changes to your master branch.  You can then delete
your experimental branch.  Alternately, you can wait until your changes
(assuming you sent them in) make it into the official repository before
deleting your experimental branch.

16.3 Sending Patches
====================

When sending patches to the mailing list for inclusion in StumpWM, there
are a few guidelines that will make everything go smoother.

   • Make sure it applies clean to the main git repository

   • Ensure that you aren’t introducing tabs, extra blank lines, or
     whitespace at the end of lines.

   • Ensure your patch doesn’t contain irrelevant indenting or
     reformatting changes.

   • Try to make your patch address a single issue.  If your patch
     changes two unrelated issues, break them into two seperate patches
     that can stand on their own.

   • Don’t send intermediate patches.  When you’re working on a feature
     you might make several commits to your local repository as you
     refine it and work out the bugs.  When it’s polished and ready to
     ship, send it as one patch!  Sometimes it makes sense to send it as
     multiple patches if each patch contains a discrete feature or bug
     fix that can stand on its own.  If one of your patches changes code
     that was added or modified in an earlier patch, consider merging
     them together and sending them as one.
