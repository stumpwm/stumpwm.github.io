1 Introduction
**************

StumpWM is a manual, tiling X11 window manager written entirely in
Common Lisp.  Unlike traditional window managers, StumpWM places windows
in order to maximize the amount of the screen used.  The window layouts
managed by StumpWM are defined by the user in much the same way that
windows are managed by GNU screen, or emacs.

   Before StumpWM, there was ratpoison, another tiling window manager
written entirely in C. StumpWM grew out of the authors’ frustration with
writing ratpoison in C. Very quickly we realized we were building into
ratpoison lispy-emacs style paradigms.  StumpWM’s goals are similar to
ratpoison’s but with an emphasis on customizability, completeness, and
cushiness.

1.1 Starting StumpWM
====================

There are a number of ways to start StumpWM but the most straight
forward method is as follows.  This assumes you have a copy of the
StumpWM source code and are using the ‘SBCL’ Common Lisp environment.

  1. Install the prerequisites and build StumpWM as described in
     ‘README’.  This should give you a ‘stumpwm’ executable.

  2. In your ‘~/.xinitrc’ file include the line ‘/path/to/stumpwm’.
     Remember to replace ‘/path/to/’ with the actual path.

  3. Finally, start X windows with ‘startx’.  Cross your fingers.  You
     should see a ‘Welcome To the Stump Window Manager’ message pop up
     in the upper, right corner.  At this point, you have successfully
     started StumpWM.

 -- Function: stumpwm &optional (display-str (or (getenv DISPLAY) :0))
     Start the stump window manager.

   @ stumpwm


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Basic Usage,  Next: Basic Concepts,  Prev: Starting StumpWM,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Basic Usage
===============

Once you have StumpWM up and running, the first thing you might want to
do is start ‘emacs’.  Type ‘C-t e’, or in other words ‘Control + t’
followed by ‘e’.  Now perhaps you want an ‘xterm’.  Type ‘C-t c’.  Now
you have some programs running.

   To see a list of windows StumpWM is managing, type ‘C-t w’.  The
highlighted window is the one you’re looking at right now.  It’s the
focused window.

   All of StumpWM’s keys are bound to named commands, which can be
executed not only by keys but also from the input bar.  Type ‘C-t ;’ to
open a command prompt.  Now type ‘time’ and press return.  Note, ‘time’
can also be called by typing ‘C-t a’.  Throughout this manual you’ll
find definitions for commands, functions, and variables.  Any command
you see in this manual can be executed from the input bar or bound to a
key.

   At this point you probably want to switch back from your new ‘xterm’
to ‘emacs’.  Type ‘C-t C-t’.  This runs the ‘other’ command.  Type it
again and you’re back to xterm.

   Perhaps you’d like to see ‘emacs’ and ‘xterm’ side-by-side.  Type
‘C-t s’.  You have now split the screen into 2 ‘frames’.  For more
information see *note Frames::.  To switch to the empty frame type ‘C-t
TAB’.  Now let’s pull the xterm window into this empty frame.  Type ‘C-t
w’ for a window listing.  Find the ‘xterm’ window.  See the number
beside it?  Type ‘C-t’ followed by ‘xterm’’s window number.

   Another common activity is browsing the internet.  Type ‘C-t !’.  The
input bar pops up again.  You can now run a shell command.  Let’s start
a web browser: type ‘firefox’ into the input bar and press return.

   Unfortunately, ‘firefox’ probably isn’t wide enough because it’s in
one of the frames.  Type ‘C-t Q’ to remove all frames but the current
one and resize it to fit the screen.

   For a full list of key bindings, see *note List of Default
Keybindings::.

1.3 Basic Concepts
==================

An introduction to some of the basic concepts used by StumpWM.

* Menu:

* Screens and Heads::
* Group Basics::
* Floating Group Basics::
* Frame Basics::
* Window Basics::
* System Trays and the Mode Line::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Screens and Heads,  Next: Group Basics,  Prev: Basic Concepts,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.1 Screens and Heads
-----------------------

A screen is an Xlib concept representing a section of video memory onto
which physical monitors, called “heads”, are mapped.  A screen can be
thought of as an abstract rectangle containing all the heads arranged in
a particular layout.

   With most modern systems, you’ll only have a single screen no matter
how many heads are connected to your computer.  Each head will have its
own frame, and you can move between heads using the normal frame
movement commands.

   The layout of the heads within the screen can be specified in one of
two ways: either at startup using your system’s Xorg configuration
files, or on the fly using tools like XRandR. If the computer is booted
with multiple monitors attached, but without specifying a layout for
them, they will all show identical output.

   StumpWM will attempt to detect the layout of the heads once at
startup, or any time a RandR command is issued.

   In rarer setups you may have multiple screens, with one head per
screen.  That means that you’ll move between heads using screen movement
commands (‘snext’, ‘sprev’, and ‘sother’) rather than frame movement
commands.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Group Basics,  Next: Floating Group Basics,  Prev: Screens and Heads,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.2 Group Basics
------------------

A group is usually referred to as a “desktop” or “workspace” in other
window managers.  StumpWM starts with a single group, called “Default”.
Each group has its own configuration of frames and windows that is
separate from and independent of other groups.  You can’t have different
groups display in different monitors: when you switch groups, all
monitors switch to that group.

   Each group contains an ordered list of frames.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Floating Group Basics,  Next: Frame Basics,  Prev: Group Basics,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.3 Floating Group Basics
---------------------------

Within a floating group, windows behave more like they do in traditional
window managers: rather than being arranged into frames, they each have
their own box, which can be freely resized and repositioned, and allowed
to overlap.  Each window has a thicker border at the top.  Left click in
this border and drag to move the window, or right click and drag to
resize it.

   A modifier key can be used to perform the move and resize operations
by clicking in the window itself instead of on its top border.  The
default modifier is super, and can be configured with
*FLOAT-WINDOW-MODIFIER*.

 -- Variable: *float-window-modifier*
     The keyboard modifier to use for resize and move floating windows
     without clicking on the top border.  Valid values are :META :ALT
     :HYPER :SUPER, :ALTGR and :NUMLOCK.

   Most of the window-switching commands listed below do not function in
a floating group.  You’re restricted to ‘other’, the ‘select-window-*’
commands, and ‘windowlist’.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Frame Basics,  Next: Window Basics,  Prev: Floating Group Basics,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.4 Frame Basics
------------------

Frames are the boxes within which windows are displayed.  StumpWM starts
with a single frame per head, meaning that each monitor shows a single
window, full screen.  If you want to see windows side-by-side, you can
“split” this frame in two, either vertically or horizontally.  These
frames can be further split, creating nested boxes.

   Technically speaking, frames live within a “frame tree”.  When you
split a frame, the command actually creates _two_ new frames
side-by-side within the original parent frame.  This makes no practical
difference, unless you use the ‘sibling’ command, which will move to the
other child frame within the parent frame.

   Within this frame tree model, all frames either contain other frames,
or windows.  The command ‘fclear’ will hide all a frame’s windows and
show the background.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Window Basics,  Next: System Trays and the Mode Line,  Prev: Frame Basics,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.5 Window Basics
-------------------

Windows are created by programs to display their output.  They take the
shape of the frame in which they are created.  The windows within a
frame are ordered by how recently that window was focused.  Only the top
window in the stack is visible.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: System Trays and the Mode Line,  Prev: Window Basics,  Up: Basic Concepts

1.3.6 System Trays and the Mode Line
------------------------------------

Many users choose to sacrifice a little screen real-estate to display
some generally useful information: the current time and date, wireless
network connections, the names of open windows, etc.  StumpWM allows you
to display this information in a bar across either the top or the bottom
of the screen.  There are two ways to do this: using external programs
called system trays, or using StumpWM’s own mode line.

   System trays are a special kind of X window.  They advertise to
running programs that they are available for embedding icons or
notifications from those programs.  They often also display clickable
icons for each open window.  Common tray programs include the GNOME
panel or KDE’s kicker, or simpler programs such as stalonetray.  Simply
starting one of these programs is usually enough for StumpWM to detect
it, place it correctly, and allow it to function normally.

   The mode line, a concept borrowed from Emacs, is a built-in part of
StumpWM. It is essentially a string of text that can include a variety
of information about your current session, including the names of
current groups and windows.  Several modules provide for different types
of information.  *Note Mode Line: Mode-line, (and the modules directory)
for more.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Manipulating Frames and Windows,  Next: Interacting with the Lisp process,  Prev: Basic Concepts,  Up: Introduction

1.4 Manipulating Frames and Windows
===================================

Frames and windows are concepts borrowed from Emacs and the GNU Screen
program, and should be familiar to users of those programs.  Others may
find the terms a little confusing.  In other window managers, a “window”
usually refers to a bounded box on the screen, showing output from a
single program.  StumpWM splits this into two concepts: the “frame” is
the bounded box, the “window” is the visible output of a program.

   One frame can contain many windows.  As new windows are created, they
appear at the top of the window-stack of the current frame.  This is
also a little different from other tiling window managers, many of which
automatically create new frames for new windows.

   Both frames and windows are ordered by when they were last focused.
In the following commands and documentation, the terms “next” and
“previous” refer to this order.  “Other” refers to the most-recently
focused object.  Calling “other” commands multiple times will bounce
back and forth between the two most recent objects.

   By default, StumpWM starts with a single group, called “Default”,
which contains one full-screen frame per head.  You can split individual
frames horizontally or vertically using the ‘hsplit’ and ‘vsplit’
commands, bound to “C-t S” and “C-t s” by default.  When a frame is
split, the next-most-recently-focused window is pulled into the new
frame.  *Note Frames::, and *note Windows::, for a complete listing of
commands.

* Moving Between Frames::
* Manipulating Windows::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Moving Between Frames,  Next: Manipulating Windows,  Prev: Manipulating Frames and Windows,  Up: Manipulating Frames and Windows

1.4.1 Moving Between Frames
---------------------------

Once you have multiple frames, you can move between them in various
ways:

   • ‘fnext’ (‘C-t o’ or ‘C-t TAB’) jumps to the next frame in the
     current group’s frame list.

   • ‘fother’ (‘C-t M-TAB’) jumps to the last frame that had focus.

   • ‘fselect’ (‘C-t f’) displays numbers on each visible frame: hit a
     number key or click it to move to that frame.

   • ‘move-focus’ (‘C-t <arrow key>’) focus the frame in the direction
     of the arrow key pressed.

   • ‘sibling’ (unbound by default) focus the frame from which the
     current frame was split.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Manipulating Windows,  Prev: Moving Between Frames,  Up: Manipulating Frames and Windows

1.4.2 Manipulating Windows
--------------------------

Some commands change which window is currently focused, some move
windows between frames, and some may do both at once.

   There are two general ways to move focus between windows: either
between windows belonging to the current frame, or between all windows
within the current group.  Within a single frame:

   • ‘next-in-frame’ (‘C-t C-M-n’) focus the next window in the current
     frame’s list of windows.

   • ‘prev-in-frame’ (‘C-t C-M-p’) focus the previous window in the
     current frame’s list of windows.

   • ‘other-in-frame’ (‘C-t M-t’) focus the most recently focused window
     in the current frame’s list of windows.

   • ‘frame-windowlist’ (unbound by default) display a menu of windows
     in the currently-focused frame, and allow the user to choose one.
     Alternately, the command ‘frame-windows’ will simply display the
     list of window names, with no menu choice available.

   Within the current group, the following commands will go straight to
the specified window.  They will never move a window from its original
frame, and so may result in focus switching frames.

   • ‘next’ (‘C-t M-n’) focus the next window in the current group.

   • ‘prev’ (‘C-t M-p’) focus the previous window in the current group.

   • ‘other’ or ‘other-window’ (unbound by default) focus the most
     recently focused window in the current group.

   • ‘next-urgent’ (‘C-t C-u’) focus the next window that has marked
     itself “urgent”.

   • ‘select’ or ‘select-window’ (‘C-t '’) prompt for the title of a
     window and focus it.  Works with partial completion of the title.

   • ‘select-window-by-name’ (unbound by default) prompt for the title
     of a window and focus it.  Requires the window title to be entered
     exactly.

   • ‘select-window-by-number’ (‘C-t <number>’) choose a window by
     number.

   • ‘windowlist’ (‘C-t "’) display a menu of windows in the
     currently-focused group, and allow the user to choose one.

   The following commands always keep the current frame focused.  If the
selected window is not in the current frame, it will be pulled there
from wherever it is (hence the “pull” naming scheme).

   • ‘pull’ or ‘pull-window-by-number’ (‘C-t C-<number>’) pull the
     numbered window into the current frame.

   • ‘pull-hidden-next’ (‘C-t n’ or ‘C-t SPC’) pull the next currently
     undisplayed window in the window list into the current frame.

   • ‘pull-hidden-previous’ (‘C-t p’) pull the previous currently
     undisplayed window in the window list into the current frame.

   • ‘pull-hidden-other’ (‘C-t C-t’) pull the most recently focused,
     currently undisplayed window into the current frame.

   The following commands move the current window from one frame to
another, bringing focus with them.

   • ‘move-window’ (‘C-t M-<arrow>’) move the currently focused window
     in the direction indicated by the arrow key.

   • ‘exchange-direction’ (unbound by default) prompt for a direction,
     then swap the currently focused window with the top window of the
     frame in that direction.

1.5 Interacting with the Lisp process
=====================================

Since StumpWM is a Lisp program, there is a way for you to evaluate Lisp
code directly, on the same Lisp process that StumpWM is running on.
Type ‘C-t :’ and an input box will appear.  Then type some Lisp
expression.

   When you call ‘eval’ this way, you will be in the STUMPWM-USER
package, which imports all the exported symbols from the main STUMPWM
package.

‘*mode-line-border-width*’
     Reads the value of *MODE-LINE-BORDER-WIDTH*.

‘(setf *mode-line-border-width* 3)’
     Sets the variable *MODE-LINE-BORDER-WIDTH* to 3.

‘(set-prefix-key (kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))’
     Calls the ‘set-prefix-key’ function (and sets a new keyboard
     prefix)

1.6 Init File
=============

Like other window managers, StumpWM’s configuration and startup state
can be controlled by an initialization file.  Unlike other window
managers, StumpWM’s init is not limited to changing settings and
keybindings.  The init file is itself a Common Lisp program running in a
Common Lisp environment, so you can write your own hacks and make them a
part of your StumpWM experience.

   On launch, StumpWM searches for an init file of different names and
locations on your system, and will use the first one found in this
order:

   • ‘~/.stumpwmrc’ is the classic UNIX-style configuration name;

   • ‘~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp’ is an Emacs-style location and name;

   • ‘~/.config/stumpwm/config’ is the XDG standard;

   • ‘/etc/stumpwmrc’ is a system-wide file giving all users a
     standardized environment.

   StumpWM includes a basic ‘sample-stumpwm.lisp’ in its source
directory.  You can use this as a template when you’re starting out:
copy it to the above name and location you prefer and edit it to suit
your preferences.

   It is possible to split your initialization among multiple files, if
you call the additional files from within an init file matching the
names and locations listed above.

 -- Variable: *processing-existing-windows*
     True when processing pre-existing windows at startup.

2.1 List of Default Keybindings
===============================

The following is a list of keybindings.

‘C-t D’
     Select the window with the corresponding digit D

‘C-t C-D’
     Pull the window with the corresponding digit D into the current
     frame

‘C-t n’
‘C-t C-n’
‘C-t Space’
     Go to the next window in the window list

‘C-t p’
‘C-t C-p’
     Go to the previous window in the window list

‘C-t '’
     Go to a window by name

‘C-t "’
     Select a window from a list and focus the window.

‘C-t C-g’
     Abort the current command.  This is useful if you accidentally hit
     ‘C-t’

‘C-t i’
     Display information about the current window.

‘C-t f’
     Select a frame by number

‘C-t s’
     Split current frame vertically

‘C-t S’
     Split current frame horizontally

‘C-t k’
‘C-t C-k’
     Sends a kill message to the current frame and the running program.

‘C-t K’
     Kills the current frame and running program; like a ‘kill -9’.

‘C-t c’
‘C-t C-c’
     Run an X terminal; by default ‘xterm’

‘C-t e’
‘C-t C-e’
     Run Emacs or raise it if it is already running.

‘C-t t’
     Sends a ‘C-t’ to the frame; this is useful for applications like
     Firefox which make heavy use of ‘C-t’ (in Firefox’s case, for
     opening a new tab).  This is similar to how GNU screen uses ‘C-a
     a’.

‘C-t w’
‘C-t C-w’
     Prints out a list of all the windows, their number, and their name.

‘C-t RET’
‘C-t C-RET’
     Show all windows and let the user select one, make that window the
     focus.

‘C-t b’
‘C-t C-b’
     Banish the mouse point to the lower right corner of the screen.

‘C-t a’
‘C-t C-a’
     Display the current time and date, much like the Unix command
     ‘date’.

‘C-t C-t’
     Switch to the last window to have focus in the current frame.

‘C-t !’
     Prompt for a shell command to run via ‘/bin/sh’.  All output is
     discarded.

‘C-t R’
     If the screen is split into multiple frames, one split will be
     undone.  If there is only one split, the effect will be the same as
     ‘C-t Q’.

‘C-t o’
‘C-t TAB’
     If the screen is split into multiple frames, focus shifts to the
     ‘next’ frame, where it cycles to the right and then down; analogous
     to ‘C-x o’ in Emacs.

‘C-t F’
     Display “Current Frame” in the frame which has focus.

‘C-t ;’
     Opens the input box.  StumpWM commands can be run from here, and
     the input history moved through.

‘C-t :’
     Opens the input box, but all things typed in here will be sent to
     the Common Lisp interpreter where they will be run as Lisp
     programs; thus, input should be valid Common Lisp.

‘C-t C-h’
‘C-t ?’
     The help.

‘C-t -’
     Hide all frames and show the root window.

‘C-t Q’
     Removes all splits and maximizes the frame with focus.

‘C-t Up’
‘C-t Down’
‘C-t Left’
‘C-t Right’
     Shift focus to an adjacent frame in the specified direction.  ‘C-t
     Up’ will shift focus up, if possible, ‘C-t Down’ will shift
     downwards, etc.

‘C-t v’
     Prints out the version of the running StumpWM.

‘C-t #’
     Toggle the mark on the current window

‘C-t m’
‘C-t C-m’
     Display the last message.  Hitting this keybinding again displays
     the message before that, and so on.

‘C-t l’
‘C-t C-l’
     redisplay the current window and force it to take up the entire
     frame.

‘C-t G’
     Display all groups and windows in each group.  For more information
     see *note Groups::.

‘C-t FN’
     Jump to the corresponding group N.  ‘C-t F1’ jumps to group 1 and
     so on.

‘C-t g g’
     Show the list of groups.

‘C-t g c’
     Create a new group.

‘C-t g n’
‘C-t g C-n’
‘C-t g SPC’
‘C-t g C-SPC’
     Go to the next group in the list.

‘C-t g N’
     Go to the next group in the list and bring the current window
     along.

‘C-t g p’
‘C-t g C-p’
     Go to the previous group in the list.

‘C-t g P’
     Go to the previous group in the list and bring the current window
     along.

‘C-t g '’

2.2 Binding Keys
================

 -- Function: define-key map key command
     Add a keybinding mapping for the key, KEY, to the command, COMMAND,
     in the specified keymap.  If COMMAND is nil, remove an exising
     binding.  For example,

          (stumpwm:define-key stumpwm:*root-map* (stumpwm:kbd "C-z") "echo Zzzzz...")

     Now when you type C-t C-z, you’ll see the text “Zzzzz...” pop up.

   @ define-key
 -- Function: undefine-key map key
     Clear the key binding in the specified keybinding.

   @ undefine-key
 -- Function: kbd keys
     This compiles a key string into a key structure used by
     ‘define-key’, ‘undefine-key’, ‘set-prefix-key’ and others.

   @ kbd
 -- Command: set-prefix-key key
     Change the stumpwm prefix key to KEY.
          (stumpwm:set-prefix-key (stumpwm:kbd "C-M-H-s-z"))

     This will change the prefix key to <Control> + <Meta> + <Hyper> +
     <Super> + the <z> key.  By most standards, a terrible prefix key
     but it makes a great example.

 -- Function: make-sparse-keymap
     Create an empty keymap.  If you want to create a new list of
     bindings in the key binding tree, this is where you start.  To hang
     frame related bindings off ‘C-t C-f’ one might use the following
     code:

          (defvar *my-frame-bindings*
            (let ((m (stumpwm:make-sparse-keymap)))
              (stumpwm:define-key m (stumpwm:kbd "f") "curframe")
              (stumpwm:define-key m (stumpwm:kbd "M-b") "move-focus left")
              m ; NOTE: this is important
            ))

          (stumpwm:define-key stumpwm:*root-map* (stumpwm:kbd "C-f") '*my-frame-bindings*)

   @ make-sparse-keymap

 -- Variable: *root-map*
     This is the keymap by default bound to ‘C-t’ (along with
     *group-root-map* and either *tile-group-root-map* or
     *float-group-root-map*).  It is known as the “prefix map”.

 -- Variable: *top-map*
     The top level key map.  This is where you’ll find the binding for
     the “prefix map”.

 -- Variable: *groups-map*
     The keymap that group related key bindings sit on.  It is bound to
     ‘C-t g’ by default.

 -- Variable: *group-top-maps*
     An alist of the top level maps for each group type.  For a given
     group, all maps whose type matches the given group are active.  So
     for a tile-group, both the group map and tile-group map are active.

     Order is important.  Each map is seached in the order they appear
     in the list (inactive maps being skipped).  In general the order
     should go from most specific groups to most general groups.

 -- Variable: *exchange-window-map*
     The keymap that exchange-window key bindings sit on.  It is bound
     to ‘C-t x’ by default.

 -- Command: bind key command
     Hang a key binding off the escape key.

 -- Command: unbind key
     Remove a key binding from the escape key.

 -- Command: send-escape
     Send the escape key to the current window.

 -- Function: grab-pointer screen
     Grab the pointer and set the pointer shape.

   @ grab-pointer
 -- Function: ungrab-pointer
     Remove the grab on the cursor and restore the cursor shape.

   @ ungrab-pointer
 -- Variable: *banish-pointer-to*
     Where to put the pointer when no argument is given to
     (banish-pointer) or the banish command.  May be one of :screen
     :head :frame or :window

 -- Function: final-key-p keys class
     Determine if the key is a memeber of a class

   @ final-key-p
 -- Function: help-key-p keys
     If the key is for the help command.

   @ help-key-p
 -- Function: cancel-key-p keys
     If a key is the cancelling key binding.

   @ cancel-key-p
 -- Variable: *editor-bindings*
     A list of key-bindings for line editing.

 -- Variable: *numpad-map*
     A keycode to keycode map to re-wire numpads when the numlock key is
     active

2.3 Modifiers
=============

Many users have had some difficulty with setting up modifiers for
StumpWM keybindings.  This is caused by a combination of how StumpWM
handles modifiers and the default modifiers list for many users’ X
servers.

   • My “Super” key doesn’t work!

     This is most likely caused by having the Hyper and Super keys
     listed as the same modifier in the modifier list.

          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4        Super_L (0x7f),  Hyper_L (0x80)
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

     The problem is in the line beginning with “mod4”.  The way to set
     up the modifier list correctly is to have just the Super key as the
     mod4 modifier.  The following ‘xmodmap’ commands will do just that.

          # clear out the mod4 modifier
          $ xmodmap -e 'clear mod4'
          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

          # add Super as a mod4 modifier
          $ xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'
          $ xmodmap
          xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

          shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
          lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
          control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
          mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71),  Meta_L (0x9c)
          mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
          mod3
          mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_L (0x7f)
          mod5        Mode_switch (0x5d),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x7c)

     You can automate this by storing the commands in a file and calling
     xmodmap when you start your X session.

          $ cat ~/.Xmodmap
          clear mod4
          add mod4 = Super_L

     If you use ‘startx’, modify your ‘~/.xsession’ or ‘~/.xinitrc’
     file.

          $ cat ~/.xsession
          #!/bin/sh

          xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
          exec /usr/bin/stumpwm

     If you use a settings daemon from one of the major desktop
     environments (Gnome,KDE, or Unity) you may be able to set keyboard
     modifiers from their respective configuration GUIs.  If not,
     ‘xmodmap’ should always work if invoked at the right place.

   • Handling Meta and Alt: when do I use ‘M-’ and ‘A-’?

     If you have no Meta keys defined (see the output of the ‘xmodmap’
     command), then StumpWM will treat the ‘M-’ prefix in keybindings to
     mean Alt.  However, if there are Meta keys defined, then the ‘M-’
     prefix refers to them, and the ‘A-’ prefix refers to Alt.

     Most users will simply use ‘M-’ to refer to their Alt keys.
     However, users that define separate Meta and Alt keys will use ‘M-’
     to refer to the former, and ‘A-’ to refer to the latter.

   • How can I set up a Hyper key and use it with StumpWM?

     To set up a Hyper key, you need to do two things: bind a physical
     key to be a Hyper key, and add that key to the modifiers list.

     The following example shows how to bind the control key at the
     bottom-left of most keyboards to be Hyper.  This is useful if
     you’ve made Caps Lock into a control key, and have no use for the
     bottom-left key.

          $ xmodmap -e 'keycode 37 = Hyper_L'
          $ xmodmap -e 'clear mod5'
          $ xmodmap -e 'add mod5 = Hyper_L'

     To use a different key for Hyper, replace the keycode “37” above.
     Use the ‘xev’ program to see the keycode that any physical key has.
     Refer to the section above on setting up the Super key to see how
     to automate setting the Hyper key when you start X.

     Now you can use ‘H-’ as a prefix in StumpWM bindings.

          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-RET") "fullscreen")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Left") "gprev")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-Right") "gnext")
          (define-key *top-map* (kbd "H-TAB") "other")

     Since essentially no programs have Hyper bindings, you can safely
     bind commands to the *TOP-MAP*.

 -- Variable: *all-modifiers*
     A list of all keycodes that are considered modifiers

 -- Variable: *modifiers*
     A mapping from modifier type to x11 modifier.

2.4 Remapped Keys
=================

StumpWM may be configured to translate certain familiar top level
keybindings to alternative key sequences that are understood by specific
applications.  For example, Emacs users are very familiar with ‘C-n’ and
‘C-p’ as keybindings for scrolling down and up one line at a time.
However, most applications use these specific keybindings for other
actions.  The ‘stumpwm:define-remapped-keys’ function may be used to
define such application specific remapping of keybindings.

 -- Function: define-remapped-keys specs
     Define the keys to be remapped and their mappings.  The SPECS
     argument needs to be of the following structure:

     (regexp-or-function .  (("key-to-remap" .  <new-keycodes>) ...))

     EXAMPLE: (define-remapped-keys ’(("Firefox" ("C-n" .  "Down")
     ("C-p" .  "Up") ("C-k" .  ("C-S-End" "C-x")))))

     The above form remaps Ctrl-n to Down arrow, and Ctrl-p to Up arrow
     keys.  The Ctrl-k key is remapped to the sequence of keys
     Ctrl-Shift-End followed by Ctrl-x.

   @ define-remapped-keys

     (define-remapped-keys
         '(("(Firefox|Chrome)"
            ("C-n"   . "Down")
            ("C-p"   . "Up")
            ("C-f"   . "Right")
            ("C-b"   . "Left")
            ("C-v"   . "Next")
            ("M-v"   . "Prior")
            ("M-w"   . "C-c")
            ("C-w"   . "C-x")
            ("C-y"   . "C-v")
            ("M-<"   . "Home")
            ("M->"   . "End")
            ("C-M-b" . "M-Left")
            ("C-M-f" . "M-Right")
            ("M-f"   . "C-Right")
            ("M-b"   . "C-Left")
            ("C-k"   . ("C-S-End" "C-x")))))

   The above form adds Emacs like keybindings to windows whose
WINDOW-CLASS matches “Firefox” or “Chrome”.  Additional application
specific bindings may be included by using the specific X WINDOW-CLASS
values.

   The window matching pattern can also be specified as a function which
returns ‘T’ if the focused window matches.

     ;; Match any window with a window-class matching "Firefox"
     (define-remapped-keys
         `((,(lambda (win)
               (string-equal "Firefox" (window-class win)))
            ("C-n"   . "Down")
            ("C-p"   . "Up")
            ("C-f"   . "Right")
            ("C-b"   . "Left")
            ("C-v"   . "Next")
            ("M-v"   . "Prior")
            ("M-w"   . "C-c")
            ("C-w"   . "C-x")
            ("C-y"   . "C-v")
            ("M-<"   . "Home")
            ("M->"   . "End")
            ("C-M-b" . "M-Left")
            ("C-M-f" . "M-Right")
            ("M-f"   . "C-Right")
            ("M-b"   . "C-Left")
            ("C-k"   . ("C-S-End" "C-x")))))

2.4.1 Circumventing Remapped Keys
---------------------------------

However, if the original key binding needs to be explictly applied the
‘send-raw-key’ command may be used.  It will prompt for a key which will
be passed to the application as-is.  For example, if the ‘send-raw-key’
command were bound to ‘C-t C-q’ as follows:

     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "C-q") "send-raw-key")

   Then, pressing ‘C-t C-q’, while the Firefox window has focus, would
prompt asking for “Press a key to send”.  Pressing ‘C-n’ at the prompt
will send the keystroke as-is to Firefox, causing it to open a new
window.

   If more than a single key needs to be passed to the application
as-is, the variable *REMAPPED-KEYS-ENABLED-P* may be used.  Set to nil
it will disable all remapped keys.

 -- Command: send-raw-key
     Prompts for a key and forwards it to the CURRENT-WINDOW.

 -- Variable: *remapped-keys-enabled-p*
     Bool to toggle remapped-keys on/off.  Defaults to t

3 Commands
**********

If you’ve used Emacs before you’ll find the distinction between commands
and functions familiar.  Commands are simply functions that can be bound
to keys and executed interactively from StumpWM’s input bar.  Whereas,
in Emacs, the special "(interactive)" declaration is used to turn a
function into a command, in StumpWM commands are made with a separate
‘defcommand’ or ‘define-interactive-keymap’ macro.

   Once a command is defined, you can call it by invoking the ‘colon’
command (‘C-t ;’), and typing the name of the command.  This may be
sufficient for commands that aren’t used very often.  To see all the
currently-defined commands, invoke the command called ‘commands’: ie
press ‘C-t ;’, type “commands”, and hit return.

   Commonly-used commands can also be bound to a keystroke, which is
much more convenient.  To do this, use the ‘define-key’ function (see
*note Key Bindings::), giving the name of the command as a string.  For
example:

     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "d") "exchange-direction")

   You cannot give the command name as a symbol, nor can you bind a key
to a regular function defined with ‘defun’.

   If the command takes arguments (see *note Writing Commands::), you
can fix those arguments when defining the key-binding, by including the
arguments in the same string as the command name, separated by a space.
For instance, the ‘exchange-direction’ command, which is unbound by
default, requires a direction in which to exchange windows.  If you call
‘exchange-direction’ directly, it will prompt you for the direction.  If
you know that you often exchange in left/right directions, and want
those actions bound to keys, you can use the following in your
customization file:

     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "[") "exchange-direction left")
     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "]") "exchange-direction right")

   Multiple arguments can be included by adding them to the command
string, separated by spaces.  Not all argument types can be represented
as strings, but StumpWM will do its best to convert types.

   StumpWM does not implement the Emacs concept of prefix arguments.

File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Writing Commands,  Next: StumpWM Types,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Commands

3.1 Writing Commands
====================

StumpWM commands are written much like any Lisp function.  The main
difference is in the way command arguments are specified.  The
‘defcommand’ macro takes a list of arguments as its first form (similar
to the ‘defun’ macro), and a corresponding list of types as its second
form.  All arguments must belong to a “type”.  Each type specification
has two parts: a keyword specifying the argument type, and a string
prompt that will be displayed when asking the user to enter the argument
value.  A typical ‘defcommand’ might look like this:

     (defcommand now-we-are-six (name age)
         ((:string "Enter your name: ")
          (:number "Enter your age: "))
       (message "~a, in six years you will be ~a" name (+ 6 age)))

   If ‘now-we-are-six’ is called interactively via the ‘colon’ command,
the user will be prompted for a string and a number, which will then be
bound to “name” and “age”, respectively, in the body of the command.

   When invoking the command via a key-binding, it is possible to
provide some or all of the arguments directly:

     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "L") "now-we-are-six John")

   In this case, hitting ‘C-t L’ will only prompt for an age (the first
string argument is already bound to “John”).  Argument values provided
this way always bind to the earliest arguments defined: ie, it is not
possible to specify an age, but prompt the user for a name.

   If the type declaration does not include a prompt (ie, it looks like
“(:type nil)”, or “(:type)” or just “:type”), the argument is considered
optional.  It can be provided via a key-binding invocation, as above,
but if it isn’t, the user will not be prompted, and the argument will be
bound to nil.

   It is possible to limit the scope under which the command will be
usable: a command can be defined to work only in tile groups, or only in
floating groups (the only two types of groups that currently exist).
This is done by replacing the name of the command with a two-element
list: the name of the command as a symbol, and either the symbol
tile-group or floating-group.  For instance, the ‘next’ command, which
only functions in tile groups, is defined this way:

     (defcommand (next tile-group) ...)

 -- Macro: defcommand name (&rest args) (&rest interactive-args) &body
          body
     Create a command function and store its interactive hints in
     *command-hash*.  The local variable %interactivep% can be used to
     check if the command was called interactively.  If it is non-NIL
     then it was called from a keybinding or from the colon command.

     The NAME argument can be a string, or a list of two symbols.  If
     the latter, the first symbol names the command, and the second
     indicates the type of group under which this command will be
     usable.  Currently, tile-group and floating-group are the two
     possible values.

     INTERACTIVE-ARGS is a list of the following form: ((TYPE PROMPT)
     (TYPE PROMPT) ...)

     each element in INTERACTIVE-ARGS declares the type and prompt for
     the command’s arguments.

     TYPE can be one of the following:

     :Y-OR-N
          A yes or no question returning T or NIL.
     :VARIABLE
          A lisp variable
     :FUNCTION
          A lisp function
     :COMMAND
          A stumpwm command as a string.
     :KEY-SEQ
          A key sequence starting from *TOP-MAP*
     :WINDOW-NUMBER
          An existing window number
     :NUMBER
          An integer number
     :STRING
          A string
     :KEY
          A single key chord
     :WINDOW-NAME
          An existing window’s name
     :DIRECTION
          A direction symbol.  One of :UP :DOWN :LEFT :RIGHT
     :GRAVITY
          A gravity symbol.  One of :center :top :right :bottom :left
          :top-right :top-left :bottom-right :bottom-left
     :GROUP
          An existing group
     :FRAME
          A frame
     :SHELL
          A shell command
     :REST
          The rest of the input yet to be parsed.
     :MODULE
          An existing stumpwm module

     Note that new argument types can be created with
     DEFINE-STUMPWM-TYPE.

     PROMPT can be string.  In this case, if the corresponding argument
     is missing from an interactive call, stumpwm will use prompt for
     its value using PROMPT. If PROMPT is missing or nil, then the
     argument is considered an optional interactive argument and is not
     prompted for when missing.

     Alternatively, instead of specifying nil for PROMPT or leaving it
     out, an element can just be the argument type.

 -- Macro: defcommand-alias alias original
     Since interactive commands are functions and can conflict with
     package symbols.  But for backwards compatibility this macro
     creates an alias name for the command that is only accessible
     interactively.

 -- Variable: *last-command*
     Set to the last interactive command run.

3.2 Interactive Keymaps
=======================

Interactive keymaps are a special type of command that basically pushes
another keymap on top of the current one.  The new keymap will only be
removed after an exit command is run.  An example is ‘iresize’.

   The macro ‘define-interactive-keymap’ is used to define an
interactive keymap.  The first argument is the same as ‘defcommand’.
The second argument is a list of extra configurations that can be used
for controlling the command and the rest are the key bindings for the
new command, optionally with a ‘t’ appended; this tells
‘define-interactive-keymap’ to exit the keymap upon use of that
keybinding.

   For instance, a simple interactive keymap:

     (define-interactive-keymap my-new-command nil
       ((kbd "a") "execute-a-command")
       ((kbd "b") "execute-b-command" t))

   This creates a command called ‘my-new-command’ that, when called,
will activate the interactive keymap mode.  In this mode, the user can
press “a” or “b” repeatedly, omitting any prefix.  The default exit
commands are ‘RET’, ‘C-g’ and ‘ESC’.

   This creates a command called ‘my-new-command’ that, when called,
will activate the interactive keymap mode.  In this mode, the user can
press “a” or “b”, omitting any prefix.  The user can press “a”
repeatedly, however pressing “b” exits the keymap.  The default exit
commands are ‘RET’, ‘C-g’ and ‘ESC’.

   The available configuration is ‘on-enter’, ‘on-exit’ and ‘abort-if’:

     (defun before-foo () (message "start foo"))
     (defun after-foo () (message "end foo"))
     (defun foo-p () (and *bar* *baz*))
     (defparameter *custom-exit-keys* '((kbd "RET") (kbd "SPC")
                                        (kbd "C-g") (kbd "ESC")))

     (define-interactive-keymap foo (:on-enter #'before-foo
                                     :on-exit #'after-foo
                                     :abort-if #'foo-p
                                     :exit-on *custom-exit-keys*))

   In the above example, the message “start foo” will appear before
starting the interactive keymap, “end foo” will appear right after the
command exits; We’ve added SPC as an exit key with custom exit keys.
Also, the command executes only if the variables ‘*bar*’ and ‘*baz*’ are
true.

 -- Macro: define-interactive-keymap name (&key on-enter on-exit
          abort-if (exit-on (quote ((kbd RET) (kbd ESC) (kbd C-g)))))
          &body key-bindings
     Declare an interactive keymap mode.  This can be used for
     developing interactive modes or command trees, such as ‘iresize’.

     The NAME argument follows the same convention as in ‘defcommand’.

     ON-ENTER and ON-EXIT are optional functions to run before and after
     the interactive keymap mode, respectively.  If ABORT-IF is defined,
     the interactive keymap will only be activated if calling ABORT-IF
     returns true.

     KEY-BINDINGS is a list of the following form: ((KEY COMMAND) (KEY
     COMMAND) ...)  If one appends t to the end of a binding like so:
     ((kbd "n") "cmd" t) then the keymap is immediately exited after
     running the command.

     Each element in KEY-BINDINGS declares a command inside the
     interactive keymap.  Be aware that these commands won’t require a
     prefix to run.

 -- Command: call-and-exit-kmap command exit-command
     This command effectively calls two other commands in succession,
     via run-commands.  it is designed for use in the
     define-interactive-keymap macro, to implement exiting the keymap on
     keypress.

3.3 StumpWM Types
=================

All command arguments must be of a defined “StumpWM type”.  The
following types are pre-defined:

:Y-OR-N
     A yes or no question returning T or NIL.
:VARIABLE
     A lisp variable
:FUNCTION
     A lisp function
:COMMAND
     A StumpWM command as a string.
:KEY-SEQ
     A key sequence starting from *TOP-MAP*
:WINDOW-NUMBER
     An existing window number
:NUMBER
     An integer number
:STRING
     A string
:KEY
     A single key chord
:WINDOW-NAME
     An existing window’s name
:DIRECTION
     A direction symbol.  One of :UP :DOWN :LEFT :RIGHT
:GRAVITY
     A gravity symbol.  One of :center :top :right :bottom :left
     :top-right :top-left :bottom-right :bottom-left
:GROUP
     An existing group
:FRAME
     A frame
:SHELL
     A shell command
:REST
     The rest of the input yet to be parsed.
:MODULE
     An existing StumpWM module

   Additional types can be defined using the macro
‘define-stumpwm-type’.  Emacs users who are accustomed to writing more
complicated interactive declarations using "(interactive (list ...))"
forms will find that similar logic can be put into StumpWM type
definitions.  The macro is called like this:

     (define-stumpwm-type :type-name (input prompt) body)

   The keyword :type-name will then be available for use in ‘defcommand’
macros.  When commands are called, the bodies of these type definitions
are called in turn to produce actual argument values.

   Type definitions produce their value in one of several ways: by
reading it from the argument line bound to a keystroke, by prompting the
user to enter a value, or by generating it programmatically.

   Within the body of the type definition, the argument “input” is bound
to the argument line provided in the command string, and “prompt” to the
string prompt provided in the ‘defcommand’ form.  The usual convention
is to first check if an argument has been provided in “input” and, if it
hasn’t, to prompt for it using “prompt”.

   StumpWM provides several convenience functions for handling the value
of “input”:

   • ‘argument-pop’ (input) pop the next space-delimited word or a
     double quote delimited string argument from the argument line.
     Backslashes may be used to escape double quotes or backslashes
     inside double quoted strings.

   • ‘argument-pop-rest’ (input) return the remainder of the argument
     line as a single string, leaving input empty

   • ‘argument-pop-or-read’ (input prompt &optional completions) either
     pop an argument from the argument line, or if it is empty use
     “prompt” to prompt the user for a value

   • ‘argument-pop-rest-or-read’ (input prompt &optional completions)
     either return the remainder of the argument line as a string,
     leaving input empty, or use “prompt” to prompt the user for a value

   As an example, here’s a new type called :smart-direction.  The
existing :direction type simply asks for one of the four directions
“left”, “right”, “up” or “down”, without checking to see if there’s a
frame in that direction.  Our new type, :smart-direction, will look
around the current frame, and only allow the user to choose a direction
in which another frame lies.  If only one direction is possible it will
return that automatically without troubling the user.  It signals an
error for invalid directions; it could alternately return a “nil” value
in those cases, and let the command handle that.

     (define-stumpwm-type :smart-direction (input prompt)
       (let ((valid-dirs
              (loop  ; gather all the directions in which there's a neighbouring frame
                 with values = '(("up" :up)
                                 ("down" :down)
                                 ("left" :left)
                                 ("right" :right))
                 with frame-set =
                   (group-frames (window-group (current-window)))
                 for dir in values
                 for neighbour = (neighbour
                                  (second dir)
                                  (window-frame (current-window)) frame-set)
                 if (and neighbour (frame-window neighbour))
                 collect dir))
             (arg (argument-pop input)))  ; store a possible argument
         (cond ((null valid-dirs)  ; no directions, bail out
                (throw 'error "No valid directions"))
               (arg  ; an arg was bound, but is it valid?
                (or (second (assoc arg valid-dirs :test #'string=))
                    (throw 'error "Not a valid direction")))
               ((= 1 (length valid-dirs))  ; only one valid direction
                (second (car valid-dirs)))
               (t  ; multiple possibilities, prompt for direction
                (second (assoc (completing-read input prompt valid-dirs
                                                :require-match t)
                               valid-dirs :test #'string=))))))

     (defcommand smarty (dir) ((:smart-direction "Pick a direction: "))
       ;; `dir' is a keyword here
       (message "You're going ~a" (string-downcase dir)))

     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "R") "smarty right")

 -- Macro: define-stumpwm-type type (input prompt) &body body
     Create a new type that can be used for command arguments.  TYPE can
     be any symbol.

     When BODY is evaluated INPUT is bound to the argument-line.  It is
     passed to ‘argument-pop’, ‘argument-pop-rest’, etc.  PROMPT is the
     prompt that should be used when prompting the user for the
     argument.

          (define-stumpwm-type :symbol (input prompt)
           (or (find-symbol
                 (string-upcase
                   (or (argument-pop input)
                       ;; Whitespace messes up find-symbol.
                       (string-trim " "
                                    (completing-read (current-screen)
                                                     prompt
                                                     ;; find all symbols in the
                                                     ;;  stumpwm package.
                                                     (let (acc)
                                                       (do-symbols (s (find-package "STUMPWM"))
                                                         (push (string-downcase (symbol-name s)) acc))
                                                       acc)))
                       (throw 'error "Abort.")))
                 "STUMPWM")
               (throw 'error "Symbol not in STUMPWM package")))

          (defcommand "symbol" (sym) ((:symbol "Pick a symbol: "))
            (message "~a" (with-output-to-string (s)
                              (describe sym s))))

     This code creates a new type called ‘:symbol’ which finds the
     symbol in the stumpwm package.  The command ‘symbol’ uses it and
     then describes the symbol.

3.4 Common Built-in Commands
============================

 -- Command: emacs
     Start emacs unless it is already running, in which case focus it.

 -- Command: version
     Print version information and compilation date.

 -- Command: banish &optional where
     Warp the mouse the lower right corner of the current head.

 -- Command: ratwarp x y
     Warp the mouse to the specified location.

 -- Command: ratrelwarp dx dy
     Warp the mouse by the specified amount from its current position.

 -- Command: ratclick &optional (button 1)
     Simulate a pointer button event at the current pointer location.
     Note: this function is unlikely to work unless your X server and
     CLX implementation support XTEST.

 -- Command: restart-hard
     Restart stumpwm.  This is handy if a new stumpwm executable has
     been made and you wish to replace the existing process with it.

     Any run-time customizations will be lost after the restart.

 -- Command: restart-soft
     Soft restart StumpWM. The lisp process isn’t restarted.  Instead,
     control jumps to the very beginning of the stumpwm program.  This
     differs from RESTART, which restarts the unix process.

     Since the process isn’t restarted, existing customizations remain
     after the restart.

 -- Command: lastmsg
     Display the last message.  If the previous command was lastmsg,
     then continue cycling back through the message history.

 -- Command: commands
     List all available commands.

 -- Command: keyboard-quit
     This way you can exit from command mode.  Also aliased as abort.

 -- Command: quit
     Quit StumpWM.

 -- Command: reload
     Reload StumpWM using ‘asdf’.

 -- Command: echo-date
     Display the date and time.

 -- Command: eval-line cmd
     Evaluate the s-expression and display the result(s).

 -- Command: command-mode
     Command mode allows you to type StumpWM commands without needing
     the <C-t> prefix.  Keys not bound in StumpWM will still get sent to
     the current window.  To exit command mode, type <C-g>.

 -- Command: list-window-properties
     List all the properties of the current window and their values,
     like xprop.

 -- Command: show-window-properties
     Shows the properties of the current window.  These properties can
     be used for matching windows with run-or-raise or window placement
     rules.

 -- Command: time &rest args
     nil

***********************

 -- Variable: *suppress-echo-timeout*
     Assign this T and messages will not time out.  It is recommended to
     assign this using LET.

 -- Command: echo string
     Display STRING in the message bar.

 -- Function: err fmt &rest args
     run FMT and ARGS through format and echo the result to the current
     screen along with a backtrace.  For careful study, the message does
     not time out.

   @ err

 -- Variable: *help-max-height*
     Maximum number of lines for help to display.

 -- Command: colon &optional initial-input
     Read a command from the user.  INITIAL-TEXT is optional.  When
     supplied, the text will appear in the prompt.

     String arguments with spaces may be passed to the command by
     delimiting them with double quotes.  A backslash can be used to
     escape double quotes or backslashes inside the string.  This does
     not apply to commands taking :REST or :SHELL type arguments.

 -- Macro: with-restarts-menu &body body
     Execute BODY. If an error occurs allow the user to pick a restart
     from a menu of possible restarts.  If a restart is not chosen,
     resignal the error.

 -- Function: restarts-menu err
     Display a menu with the active restarts and let the user pick one.
     Error is the error being recovered from.  If the user aborts the
     menu, the error is re-signalled.

4.3 Programming The Message Bar
===============================

 -- Function: echo-string screen msg
     Display STRING in the message bar on SCREEN.  You almost always
     want to use ‘message’.

   @ echo-string
 -- Function: message fmt &rest args
     run FMT and ARGS through ‘format’ and echo the result to the
     current screen.

   @ message
 -- Macro: with-message-queuing new-on-bottom-p &body body
     Queue all messages sent by (MESSAGE ...), (ECHO-STRING ...),
     (ECHO-STRING-LIST ...)  forms within BODY without clobbering
     earlier messages.  When NEW-ON-BOTTOM-P is non-nil, new messages
     are queued at the bottom.

 -- Variable: *queue-messages-p*
     When non-nil, ECHO-STRING-LIST will retain old messages in addition
     to new ones.  When the value is :new-on-bottom, new messages are
     added to the bottom as in a log file.  See also
     WITH-MESSAGE-QUEUING.

 -- Variable: *input-history-ignore-duplicates*
     Do not add a command to the input history if it’s already the first
     in the list.

 -- Variable: *input-completion-style*
     The completion style to use.  A completion style has to implement
     input-completion-reset and input-completion-complete.  Available
     completion styles include
     make-input-completion-style-cyclic
     make-input-completion-style-unambiguous

 -- Function: make-input-completion-style-cyclic
     nil

   @ make-input-completion-style-cyclic
 -- Function: make-input-completion-style-unambiguous &key
          (display-limit 64)
     nil

   @ make-input-completion-style-unambiguous
 -- Command: copy-last-message
     Copy the last message displayed into the X selection

4.4 Programming the Input Bar
=============================

New input behavior can be added to the input bar by creating editing
functions and binding them to keys in the *INPUT-MAP* using
‘define-key’, just like other key bindings.

   An input function takes 2 arguments: the input structure and the key
pressed.

 -- Function: read-one-line screen prompt &key completions
          (initial-input ) require-match password
     Read a line of input through stumpwm and return it.  Returns nil if
     the user aborted.

   @ read-one-line
 -- Function: read-one-char screen
     Read a single character from the user.

   @ read-one-char
 -- Function: completing-read screen prompt completions &key
          (initial-input ) require-match
     Read a line of input through stumpwm and return it with TAB
     completion.  Completions can be a list, an fbound symbol, or a
     function.  If its an fbound symbol or a function then that function
     is passed the substring to complete on and is expected to return a
     list of matches.  If require-match argument is non-nil then the
     input must match with an element of the completions.

   @ completing-read
 -- Function: input-insert-string input string
     Insert STRING into the input at the current position.  INPUT must
     be of type INPUT-LINE.  Input functions are passed this structure
     as their first argument.

   @ input-insert-string
 -- Function: input-insert-char input char
     Insert CHAR into the input at the current position.  INPUT must be
     of type INPUT-LINE.  Input functions are passed this structure as
     their first argument.

   @ input-insert-char

 -- Variable: *input-map*
     This is the keymap containing all input editing key bindings.

     list is sorted by number and if the WINDOWS-LIST is provided, it is
     shown unsorted (as-is).

 -- Command: windowlist-by-class &optional (fmt
          *window-format-by-class*)
     Allow the user to select a window from the list of windows (sorted

 -- Variable: *window-format*
     This variable decides how the window list is formatted.  It is a
     string with the following formatting options:

     %n
          Substitutes the window’s number translated via
          *window-number-map*, if there are more windows than
          *window-number-map* then will use the window-number.
     %s
          Substitute the window’s status.  * means current window, +
          means last window, and - means any other window.
     %t
          Substitute the window’s name.
     %c
          Substitute the window’s class.
     %i
          Substitute the window’s resource ID.
     %m
          Draw a # if the window is marked.

     Note, a prefix number can be used to crop the argument to a
     specified size.  For instance, ‘%20t’ crops the window’s title to
     20 characters.

 -- Variable: *window-info-format*
     The format used in the info command.  See *WINDOW-FORMAT* for
     formatting details.

 -- Variable: *window-name-source*
     This variable controls what is used for the window’s name.  The

     ‘:resource-name’
          Use the window’s resource name.

 -- Variable: *new-window-preferred-frame*
     This variable controls what frame a new window appears in.  It is a

          Choose the last focused frame.

     ‘:empty’
          Choose any empty frame.

     ‘:unfocused’
          Choose any unfocused frame.

     the new window, and returns the preferred frame or a list of the
     above preferences.

 -- Variable: *hidden-window-color*
     Color command for hidden windows when using the
     fmt-head-window-list-hidden-windows formatter.  To disable coloring
     hidden windows, set this to an empty string.

     ratio hints.

 -- Variable: *transient-border-width*
     The width in pixels given to the borders of transient or pop-up
     windows.

 -- Variable: *normal-border-width*
     The width in pixels given to the borders of regular windows.

 -- Variable: *window-border-style*
     This controls the appearance of the border around windows.  valid
     values are:
     :THICK
          All space within the frame not used by the window is dedicated
          to the border.

     :THIN
          Only the border width as controlled by *maxsize-border-width*
          *normal-border-width* and *transient-border-width* is used as
          the border.  The rest is filled with the unfocus color.

     :TIGHT
          The same as :thin but the border surrounds the window and the
          wasted space within the frame is not obscured, revealing the
          background.

     :NONE
          Like :tight but no border is ever visible.

     After changing this variable you may need to call
     sync-all-frame-windows to see the change.

5.3 Controlling Raise And Map Requests
======================================

It is sometimes handy to deny a window’s request to be focused.  The
following variables determine such behavior.

   A map request occurs when a new or withdrawn window requests to be
mapped for the first time.

   A raise request occurs when a client asks the window manager to give
an existing window focus.

 -- Variable: *deny-map-request*
     A list of window properties that stumpwm should deny matching
     windows’ requests to become mapped for the first time.

 -- Variable: *deny-raise-request*
     Exactly the same as *DENY-MAP-REQUEST* but for raise requests.

     Note that no denial message is displayed if the window is already
     visible.

 -- Variable: *suppress-deny-messages*
     For complete focus on the task at hand, set this to ‘T’ and no
     raise/map denial messages will be seen.

   Some examples follow.

     ;; Deny the firefox window from taking focus when clicked upon.
     (push '(:class "gecko") stumpwm:*deny-raise-request*)

     ;; Deny all map requests
     (setf stumpwm:*deny-map-request* t)

     ;; Deny transient raise requests
     (push '(:transient) stumpwm:*deny-map-request*)

     ;; Deny the all windows in the xterm class from taking focus.
     (push '(:class "Xterm") stumpwm:*deny-raise-request*)

 -- Variable: *window-events*
     The events to listen for on managed windows.

 -- Variable: *window-parent-events*
     The events to listen for on managed windows’ parents.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Rule Based Window Placement,  Next: Window Selection Expressions,  Prev: Programming With Windows,  Up: Windows

5.5 Rule Based Window Placement
===============================

 -- Macro: define-frame-preference target-group &body frame-rules
     Create a rule that matches windows and automatically places them in
     a specified group and frame.  Each frame rule is a lambda list:
          (frame-number raise lock &key from-group create restore dump-name class class-not
          instance instance-not type type-not role role-not title title-not
          match-properties-and-function match-properties-or-function)

     TARGET-GROUP
          When nil, rule applies in the current group.  When non nil,
          LOCK determines applicability of rule

     FRAME-NUMBER
          The frame number to send matching windows to

     RAISE
          When non-nil, raise and focus the window in its frame

     LOCK
          When this is nil, this rule will only match when TARGET-GROUP
          matches the group designated by FROM-GROUP.  When non-nil,
          this rule matches regardless of the group and the window is
          sent to TARGET-GROUP.  If LOCK and RAISE are both non-nil,
          then stumpwm will jump to the specified group and focus the
          matched window.

     FROM-GROUP
          When LOCK is NIL, and this is non-NIL, this rule will only
          match when TARGET-GROUP matches FROM-GROUP.  This should be
          set to either a group name(a string), or an expression that
          returns a group(e.g (current-group)).  When this is NIL, the
          rule matches if TARGET-GROUP matches the group the window is
          in, or the current group if the window has no group.
     CREATE
          When non-NIL the group is created and eventually restored when
          the value of create is a group dump filename in *DATA-DIR*.
          Defaults to NIL.

     RESTORE
          When non-NIL the group is restored even if it already exists.
          This arg should be set to the dump filename to use for forced
          restore.  Defaults to NIL

     CLASS
          The windows class must match CLASS.

     CLASS-NOT
          The windows class must not match CLASS-NOT

     INSTANCE
          The windows instance/resource name must match INSTANCE.

     INSTANCE-NOT
          The windows instance/resource name must not match
          INSTANCE-NOT.

     TYPE
          The windows type must match TYPE.

     TYPE-NOT
          The windows type must not match TYPE-NOT.

     ROLE
          The windows role must match ROLE.

     ROLE-NOT
          The windows role must not match ROLE-NOT.

     TITLE
          The windows title must match TITLE.

     TITLE-NOT
          The windows title must not match TITLE-NOT.

     MATCH-PROPERTIES-AND-FUNCTION
          A function that, if provided, must return true alongside the
          provided properties in order for the rule to match.  This
          function takes one argument, the window.

     MATCH-PROPERTIES-OR-FUNCTION
          A function that, if provided and returning true, will cause
          the rule to match regardless of whether the window properties
          match.  Takes one argument, the window.

 -- Function: clear-window-placement-rules
     Clear all window placement rules.

   @ clear-window-placement-rules

 -- Command: remember lock title
     Make a generic placement rule for the current window.  Might be too
     specific/not specific enough!

 -- Command: forget
     Forget the window placement rule that matches the current window.

 -- Command: dump-window-placement-rules file
     Dump *window-placement-rules* to FILE.

 -- Command: restore-window-placement-rules file
     Restore *window-placement-rules* from FILE.

 -- Variable: *window-placement-rules*
     List of rules governing window placement.  Use
     define-frame-preference to add rules

5.6 Window Selection Expressions
================================

Window Selection Expressions (WSE) were inspired by SQL. The intent is
to allow writing consise code to select the windows you need and to act
upon them (or just to get the list of selected windows).  The
implementation includes a set of (hopefully) consistent concisely-named
wrappers for the StumpWM functionality useful for window set description
and the act-on-matching-windows macro that encapsulates the logic of
iterating over a window set.

   If we had SQL in StumpWM, we would write ‘select window_id from
windows as w where w.title = 'XTerm'’.  WSE chooses to be more
Lisp-style and instead uses ‘(act-on-matching-windows (w) (titled-p w
"XTerm") w)’

   The ‘act-on-matching-windows’ function also allows performing some
actions, for example getting all the windows titled XTerm into the
current group: ‘(act-on-matching-windows (w) (titled-p w "XTerm")
(pull-w w))’

 -- Function: move-windows-to-group windows &optional (arggroup nil)

     :screen/:group/:frame for the current instance.  Condition is just
     the code to evaluate.

 -- Function: pull-w w &optional g
     Pull the window w: to the current group or to the specified group
     g.

     frame in specified direction.  (bound to ‘C-t x’ by default)
     up
     down
     left
     right

 -- Command: expose
     Automagically tile all windows and let the user select one, make
     that window the focus.  Set the variable ‘*expose-auto-tile-fn*’ to
     another tiling function if a different layout is desired.  Set
     ‘*expose-n-max*’ to the maximum number of windows to be displayed
     for choosing.

 -- Macro: save-frame-excursion &body body
     Execute body and then restore the current frame.

 -- Function: run-or-pull cmd props &optional (all-groups
          *run-or-raise-all-groups*) (all-screens
          *run-or-raise-all-screens*)
     Similar to run-or-raise, but move the matching window to the
     current frame instead of switching to the window.

   @ run-or-pull
 -- Function: only-one-frame-p
     T if there is only one maximized frame in the current head.  This
     can be used around a the "only" command to avoid the warning
     message.

   @ only-one-frame-p

 -- Variable: *min-frame-width*
     The minimum width a frame can be.  A frame will not shrink below
     this width.  Splitting will not affect frames if the new frame
     widths are less than this value.

 -- Variable: *min-frame-height*
     The minimum height a frame can be.  A frame will not shrink below
     this height.  Splitting will not affect frames if the new frame
     heights are less than this value.

 -- Variable: *new-frame-action*
     When a new frame is created, this variable controls what is put in
     the new frame.  Valid values are

     ‘:empty’
          The frame is left empty

     ‘:last-window’
          The last focused window that is not currently visible is
          placed in the frame.  This is the default.

 -- Variable: *expose-auto-tile-fn*
     Function to call to tile current windows.

 -- Variable: *expose-n-max*
     Maximum number of windows to display in the expose

 -- Variable: *frame-indicator-text*
     What appears in the frame indicator window?

 -- Variable: *frame-indicator-timer*
     Keep track of the timer that hides the frame indicator.

 -- Variable: *frame-number-map*
     Set this to a string to remap the frame numbers to more convenient
     keys.  For instance,

     "hutenosa"

     would map frame 0 to 7 to be selectable by hitting the appropriate
     homerow key on a dvorak keyboard.  Currently, only single char keys
     are supported.  By default, the frame labels are the 36
     (lower-case) alphanumeric characters, starting with numbers 0-9.

6.1 Interactively Resizing Frames
=================================

There is a mode called ‘iresize’ that lets you interactively resize the
current frame.  To enter the mode use the ‘iresize’ command or type <C-t
r>.

   The following keybindings apply to the mode:
‘C-p’
‘Up’
‘k’
     Shrink the frame vertically.

‘C-n’
‘Down’
‘j’
     Expand the frame vertically.

‘C-f’
‘Right’
‘l’
     Expand the frame horizontally.

‘C-b’
‘Left’
‘h’
     Shrink the frame horizontally.

‘C-g’
‘ESC’
     Abort the interactive resize.

‘RET’
     Select the highlighted option.

 -- Command: iresize
     Starts interactive command "IRESIZE"

 -- Function: setup-iresize
     Start the interactive resize mode.

   @ setup-iresize
 -- Variable: *resize-map*
     The keymap used for resizing a window

 -- Variable: *resize-increment*
     Number of pixels to increment by when interactively resizing
     frames.

6.2 Frame Dumping
=================

The configuration of frames and groups can be saved and restored using
the following commands.

 -- Command: dump-desktop-to-file file
     Dumps the frames of all groups of all screens to the named file

 -- Command: dump-group-to-file file
     Dumps the frames of the current group of the current screen to the
     named file.

 -- Command: dump-screen-to-file file
     Dumps the frames of all groups of the current screen to the named
     file

 -- Command: restore-from-file file
     Restores screen, groups, or frames from named file, depending on
     file’s contents.  Defaults to the XDG_DATA_HOME location with .dump
     file types.

 -- Command: place-existing-windows
     Re-arrange existing windows according to placement rules.

 -- Command: place-current-window
     Re-arrange current window according to placement rules.

   The configuration files are stored in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/STUMPWM.
The file name specified is saved as a ‘.dump’ file type.  For example,
‘: dump-desktop-to-file example’ may save a file in
‘~/.local/share/stumpwm/example.dump’.  ‘restore-from-file’ also adds
the ‘.dump’ extension by default.


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Mode-line,  Next: Groups,  Prev: Frames,  Up: Top

7 The Mode Line
***************

The mode line is a bar that runs across either the top or bottom of a
head and is used to display information.  By default the mode line
displays the list of windows, similar to the output ‘C-t w’ produces.

   Alternatively, external panel applications such as the GNOME panel
and KDE’s kicker may be used.  Simply starting one of these programs is
enough to set it as the mode line of the head it would like to be on (if
the panel is XRandR aware) or whichever head is available.  In order to
avoid problems displaying menus, configure your panel application for
positioning at the top or bottom of the head rather than relying on
*MODE-LINE-POSITION*

   The mode line can be turned on and off with the ‘mode-line’ command
or the lisp function ‘stumpwm:toggle-mode-line’.  Each head has its own
mode line.  For example:

     ;; turn on/off the mode line for the current head only.
     (stumpwm:toggle-mode-line (stumpwm:current-screen)
                               (stumpwm:current-head))

   The mode line is updated after every StumpWM command.

   To display the window list and the current date on the modeline, one
might do the following:

     (setf stumpwm:*screen-mode-line-format*
           (list "%w | "
                 '(:eval (stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t))))

   ‘(stumpwm:run-shell-command "date" t)’ runs the command ‘date’ and
returns its output as a string.

 -- Command: mode-line
     A command to toggle the mode line visibility.

 -- Function: toggle-mode-line screen head &optional (format (quote
          *screen-mode-line-format*))
     Toggle the state of the mode line for the specified screen

   @ toggle-mode-line

 -- Variable: *screen-mode-line-format*
     This variable describes what will be displayed on the modeline for
     each screen.  Turn it on with the function TOGGLE-MODE-LINE or the
     mode-line command.

     It is a list where each element may be a string, a symbol, or a
     list.

     For a symbol its value is used.

     For a list of the form (:eval FORM) FORM is evaluated and the
     result is used as a mode line element.

     If it is a string the string is printed with the following
     formatting options:

     %h
          List the number of the head the mode-line belongs to

     %w
          List all windows in the current group windows using
          *WINDOW-FORMAT*

     %W
          List all windows on the current head of the current group
          using *WINDOW-FORMAT*

     %g
          List the groups using *GROUP-FORMAT*

     %n
          The current group’s name

     %u
          Using *WINDOW-FORMAT*, return a 1 line list of the urgent
          windows, space seperated.

     %v
          Using *WINDOW-FORMAT*, return a 1 line list of the windows,
          space separated.  The currently focused window is highlighted
          with fmt-highlight.  Any non-visible windows are colored the
          *hidden-window-color*.

     %d
          Using *TIME-MODELINE-STRING*, print the time.

     A number of modules have been written that extends the possible
     formatting strings.  See their documentation for details.

 -- Variable: *time-format-string-default*
     The default value for ‘echo-date’, (e.g, Thu Mar 3 2005 23:05:25).

 -- Variable: *time-modeline-string*
     The default time value to pass to the modeline.

   @ bar
 -- Function: bar-zone-color amount &optional (med 20) (hi 50) (crit 90)
          reverse
     Return a color command based on the magnitude of the argument.  If
     the limits for the levels aren’t specified, they default to
     sensible values for a percentage.  With reverse, lower numbers are
     more critical.

   @ bar-zone-color
 -- Function: add-screen-mode-line-formatter character fmt-fun
     Add a format function to a format character (or overwrite an
     existing one).

   @ add-screen-mode-line-formatter
 -- Function: enable-mode-line screen head state &optional format
     Set the state of SCREEN’s HEAD’s mode-line.  If STATE is T and
     FORMAT is specified, then the mode-line’s format is updated.

     The mode line background color.

 -- Variable: *mode-line-foreground-color*
     The mode line foreground color.

 -- Variable: *mode-line-border-color*
     The mode line border color.

 -- Variable: *mode-line-timeout*
     The modeline updates after each command, when a new window appears
     or an existing one disappears, and on a timer.  This variable
     controls how many seconds elapse between each update.  If this
     variable is changed while the modeline is visible, you must toggle
     the modeline to update timer.

9.1 External Monitors
=====================

StumpWM refers to each monitor as a head.  Heads are logically contained
by screens.  In a dual-monitor configuration, there will be one screen
with two heads.  Non-rectangular layouts are supported (frames will not
be created in the ’dead zone’.)  And message windows will be displayed
on the current head–that is, the head to which the currently focused
frame belongs.

   In addition, StumpWM listens for XRandR events and re-configures the
heads to match the new monitor configuration.  Occasionally StumpWM will
miss an XRandR event, use ‘refresh-heads’ to synchronize the head
configuration.

 -- Command: refresh-heads &optional (screen (current-screen))
     Refresh screens in case a monitor was connected, but a

* Internal Functions Documentation::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: IO Loop,  Next: Internal Functions Documentation,  Up: Internals

10.1 IO Loop
============

StumpWM’s internal loop is implemented by a generic multiplexing I/O
loop for listening to I/O events from multiple sources.  The model is as
follows:

   An I/O multiplexer is represented as an object, with which I/O
channels can be registered to be monitored for events when the I/O loop
runs.  An I/O channel is any object for which the generic functions
IO-CHANNEL-IOPORT, IO-CHANNEL-EVENTS and IO-CHANNEL-HANDLE are
implemented.

   IO-CHANNEL-IOPORT, given an I/O multiplexer and an I/O channel,
should return the underlying system I/O facility that the channel
operates on.  The actual objects used to represent an I/O facility
depends on the Lisp implementation, operating system and the specific
I/O loop implementation, but, for example, on Unix implementations they
will likely be numeric file descriptors.  The I/O loop implementation
implements IO-CHANNEL-IOPORT methods for the facilities it understands
(such as FD-STREAMs on SBCL), so user-implemented channels should simply
call IO-CHANNEL-IOPORT recursively on whatever it operates on.

   IO-CHANNEL-EVENTS, given an I/O channel, should return a list of the
events that the channel is interested in.  See the documentation for
IO-CHANNEL-EVENTS for further details.

   The I/O loop guarantees that it will check what events a channel is
interested in when it is first registered, and also at any time the
channel has been notified of an event.  If the channel changes its mind
at any other point in time, it should use the IO-LOOP-UPDATE function to
notify the I/O loop of such changes.  The I/O loop may very well also
update spuriously at other times, but such updates are not guaranteed.

   IO-CHANNEL-HANDLE is called by the I/O loop to notify a channel of an
event.

   An I/O multiplexer is created with a MAKE-INSTANCE call on the class
of the desired multiplexer implementation.  If the code using the
multiplexer has no certain preferences on an implementation (which
should be the usual case), the variable *DEFAULT-IO-LOOP* points to a
class that should be generally optimal given the current Lisp
implementation and operating system.

   Given a multiplexer, channels can be registered with it using
IO-LOOP-ADD, unregistered with IO-LOOP-REMOVE, and updated with
IO-LOOP-UPDATE (as described above).  Call IO-LOOP on the multiplexer to
actually run it.

     so they can be fixed.  Use this command to copy the unhandled error
     and backtrace to the X11 selection so you can paste in your email
     when submitting the bug report.

The following is a list of commands that don’t really fit in any other
 -- Function: split-string string &optional (separators
     ) Splits STRING into substrings where there are matches for
     SEPARATORS. Each match for SEPARATORS is a splitting point.  The
     substrings between the splitting points are made into a list which
     is returned.  ***If SEPARATORS is absent, it defaults to "[
     ftnrv]+".

     If there is match for SEPARATORS at the beginning of STRING, we do
     not include a null substring for that.  Likewise, if there is a
     match at the end of STRING, we don’t include a null substring for
     that.

13.1 Menus
==========

13.2 Menus
==========

There are three different types of menus in StumpWM; single selection
menus; interactive menus; and batch menus.  Single-selection menus, as
the name suggests, are used to pick a single item from a list.
Interactive menus are used for marking multiple selections.  Batch menus
are used for performing actions on multiple menu items.  Both batch and
interactive menus share the same navigational keybindings, which are
found in the table below.  These can be customized by modifying the
*MENU-MAP* variable.  Commands specific to each menu type can be
modified by *SINGLE-MENU-MAP* and *BATCH-MENU-MAP*.

‘C-p’
‘Up’
‘k’
     Highlight the previous menu option.

‘C-n’
‘Down’
‘j’
     Highlight the next menu option.

‘S-Down’
     Scroll the entire page down one entry.

‘S-Up’
     Scroll the entire page up one entry.

‘PageUp’
     Scroll up one page.

‘PageDown’
     Scroll down one page.

‘C-g’
‘ESC’
     Abort the menu.

   In addition, you can customize the number of items shown at a time (a
page) with the *MENU-MAXIMUM-HEIGHT* variable.  The default value,
‘nil’, means that there is no limit to the page size.

 -- Variable: *menu-map*
     The keymap used by the interactive menu.

 -- Function: menu-page-up menu
     Move a whole page down in the menu

   @ menu-page-up
 -- Function: menu-page-down menu
     Move a whole page up in the menu

   @ menu-page-down
 -- Function: menu-up menu
     Move menu cursor up

   @ menu-up
 -- Function: menu-down menu
     Move menu cursor down

   @ menu-down
 -- Function: menu-scroll-up menu
     Scroll the menu up

   @ menu-scroll-up
 -- Function: menu-scroll-down menu
     Scroll the menu down

   @ menu-scroll-down
 -- Function: menu-abort menu
     What to do when exiting the menu without results.  Must signal
     :menu-quit with the result.

   @ menu-abort
 -- Function: menu-backspace menu
     What occurs when backspace is pressed in a menu

   @ menu-backspace
 -- Function: menu-entry-apply menu-entry function
     Apply FUNCTION to the data portion of the menu entry.

   @ menu-entry-apply
 -- Function: menu-entry-display menu-entry
     Generates a string suitable for displaying in a menu

   @ menu-entry-display
 -- Function: menu-finish menu
     What to do when exiting the menu with results.  Must signal
     :menu-quit with the result.

   @ menu-finish
 -- Function: command-menu screen items command-list &key (prompt
          Select:) (initial-selection 0) extra-keymap
     Use batch-menu to make selections and run commands specified in
     command-list.

     SCREEN: The screen to display the menu on.

     ITEMS: The items to be shown in the list.  This is expected to be a
     list of ‘menu-item’s.

     COMMAND-LIST: A list of entries defining the commands associated
     with each mark.  Only marks that are defined are allowed in the
     menu.  The format for these entries is (mark-character function
     calling-options).

     Available calling-options: :single (Default) Each value is passed
     separately to the supplied function.  :all all values selected with
     this mark are passed to the function in a list.

     Example: ’((#d ’delete-window) (#m ’move-multiple-windows :all))

   @ command-menu

13.2.1 Single Selection Menus
-----------------------------

Single selection menus can be searched; start typing when the menu is
active, and the results are immediately filtered.  Use <RET> to selected
the highlighted option.

‘RET’
     Select the highlighted option.

 -- Variable: *single-menu-map*
     The keymap used by single selection menus in addition to *menu-map*

 -- Function: select-from-menu screen table &optional (prompt Search:)
          (initial-selection 0) extra-keymap (filter-pred (function
          menu-item-matches-regexp))
     Prompt the user to select from a menu on SCREEN. TABLE can be a
     list of values or a nested list.  If it’s a nested list, the first
     element in the sublist is displayed in the menu.  What is displayed
     as menu items must be strings.

     EXTRA-KEYMAP can be a keymap whose bindings will take precedence
     over the default bindings.

     FILTER-PRED should be a a function returning T when a certain menu
     item should be visible to the user.  It should accept arguments

     ITEM-STRING (the string shown to the user), ITEM-OBJECT (the object
     corresponding to the menu item), and USER-INPUT (the current user
     input).  The default is MENU-ITEM-MATCHES-REGEXP. Returns the
     selected element in TABLE or nil if aborted.

   @ select-from-menu

13.2.2 Batch Menus
------------------

Batch menus provide a menu that allows the user to mark items.  Items
are marked by highlighting an item, then pressing a corresponding key.
The key pressed depends on the menu being shown, and the desired action.
For example, in a menu allowing users to manage windows, windows to be
closed/removed could be marked by <d>, and windows to be raised could be
marked by <r>.  All available actions and their keybindings are shown
below.  These can be customized with *BATCH-MENU-MAP*.

‘n’
‘Space’
     Highlight the next item.

‘p’
     Highlight the previous item.

‘u’
     Unmark the selected item, then move the cursor down.

‘DEL’
     Unmark the selected item, then move the cursor up if it is not at
     the top of the menu.

‘x’
‘RET’
     Exit the menu and perform the actions associated with each mark.

 -- Variable: *batch-menu-map*
     The keymap used by batch-menu menus in addition to *menu-map*

 -- Function: select-from-batch-menu screen table &key (prompt Select:)
          allowed-markers (initial-selection 0) extra-keymap
     Prompt the user with a menu that allows them to mark each item with
     a character.  They can exit the menu by pressing enter, or whatever
     key is mapped to ’menu-finish’ in *menu-map*.  Value returned is an
     alist, where the cdr of each entry is a list of items that were
     marked with that character.  Note that the lisp printer cannot
     distinguish between ’(a .  (b c d)) and ’(a b c d).

     Example when "foo" and "bar" are marked with ’#d’, and "baz" is not
     marked: ((#d "foo" "bar") (NIL "baz")) ALLOWED-MARKERS is a list of
     characters.  If this parameter is specified, no other markers are
     allowed.  EXTRA-KEYMAP can be a keymap whose bindings will take
     precedence over the default bindings.

13.3 StumpWM’s Data Directory
=============================

If you want to store StumpWM data between sessions, the recommended
method is to store them in ‘~/.stumpwm.d/’.  StumpWM supplies some
functions to make doing this easier.

 -- Variable: *data-dir*
     The directory used by stumpwm to store data between sessions.

 -- Function: data-dir-file name &optional type
     Return a pathname inside stumpwm’s data dir with the specified name
     and type

   @ data-dir-file
 -- Macro: with-data-file (s file &rest keys &key (if-exists supersede)
          &allow-other-keys) &body body
     Open a file in StumpWM’s data directory.  keyword arguments are
     sent directly to OPEN. Note that IF-EXISTS defaults to :supersede,
     instead of :error.

13.4 Debugging StumpWM
======================

 -- Variable: *debug-level*
     Set this variable to a number > 0 to turn on debugging.  The
     greater the number the more debugging output.

 -- Variable: *debug-stream*
     This is the stream debugging output is sent to.  It defaults to
     *error-output*.  It may be more convenient for you to pipe
     debugging output directly to a file.

 -- Variable: *debug-expose-events*
     Set this variable for a visual indication of expose events on
     internal StumpWM windows.

 -- Function: redirect-all-output file
     Elect to redirect all output to the specified file.  For instance,
     if you want everything to go to ~/.stumpwm.d/debug-output.txt you
     would do:

          (redirect-all-output (data-dir-file "debug-output" "txt"))

13.5 Sending a Bug Report
=========================

While StumpWM’s code-base is quite mature, it still contains some bugs.
If you encounter one here are some guidelines for making sure the
developers can fix it:
   • Include a procedure for reproducing the bug/bad behavior.  Ideally
     this will include numbered steps starting with instructions on how
     you start StumpWM. Also include what the expected behavior was.
   • Be as detailed as possible.  Then add more detail!
   • Make sure its not something you introduced by using an empty
     ‘.xinitrc’ containing only ‘exec /path/to/stumpwm’.
   • Make sure the bug is present even when ‘.stumpwmrc’ is empty.
   • If you are using the git version, include the hash of the master
     branch, or better include the commit when you started to notice the
     bug.
   • If you have code that fixes the bug, then open a pull request at
     <https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/compare/>.
   • If you don’t have code to fix the bug, then open an issue at
     <https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/issues/new>.

     Returns the time in seconds since idle according to the root window
     of the ‘screen’.

   @ idle-time
 -- Function: run-with-timer secs repeat function &rest args
     Perform an action after a delay of SECS seconds.  Repeat the action
     every REPEAT seconds, if repeat is non-nil.  SECS and REPEAT may be
     reals.  The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.

   @ run-with-timer
 -- Function: cancel-timer timer
     Remove TIMER from the list of active timers.

   @ cancel-timer

 -- Function: timer-p TIMER
     Return T if TIMER is a timer structure.

14 Colors
*********

When specifying a color, it is possible to use its X11 Color Name
(usually in the file ‘/etc/X11/rgb.txt’).  You can also use a six digit
hex string prefixed by a ’#’ character in the same way that you can
specify colors in HTML.

   All text printed by StumpWM is run through a coloring engine before
being displayed.  All color commands start with a ‘^’ (caret) character
and apply to all text after it.

‘^0-9’
     A caret followed by a single digit number changes the foreground
     color to the specified color.  A ‘*’ can be used to specify the
     normal color.  See the color listing below.

‘^0-90-9’
     A caret followed by two digits sets the foreground and background
     color.  The first digit refers to the foreground color and the
     second digit to the background color.  A ‘*’ can be used in place
     of either digit to specify the normal color.  See the color listing
     below.

‘^B’
     Turn on bright colors.

‘^b’
     Turn off bright colors.

‘^n’
     Use the normal background and foreground color.

‘^R’
     Reverse the foreground and background colors.

‘^r’
     Turn off reverse colors.

‘^[’
     Push the current colors onto the color stack.  The current colors
     remain unchanged.

‘^]’
     Pop the colors off the color stack.

‘^>’
     Align the rest of the line to the right of the window.

‘^f<n>’
     Sets the current font to the font at index n in the screen’s font
     list.

‘^(<modifier> &rest arguments)’
     Allows for more complicated color settings: <modifier> can be one
     of :fg, :bg, :reverse, :bright, :push, :pop, :font and :>.  The
     arguments for each modifier differ:

        • :fg and :bg take a color as an argument, which can either be a
          numeric index into the color map or a hexadecimal color in the
          form of "#fff" or "#ffffff".
        • :reverse and :bright take either t or nil as an argument.  T
          enables the setting and nil disables it.
        • :push and :pop take no arguments.  :push pushes the current
          settings onto the color stack, leaving the current settings
          intact.  :pop pops color settings off the stack, updating the
          current settings.
        • :font takes an integer that represents an index into the
          screen’s list of fonts, or, possibly, a literal font object
          that can immediately be used.  In a string you’ll probably
          only want to specify an integer.
        • :> takes no arguments.  It triggers right-alignment for the
          rest of the line.

‘^^’
     Print a regular caret.

   The default colors are made to resemble the 16 VGA colors and are:
0 black
1 red
2 green
3 yellow
4 blue
5 magenta
6 cyan
7 white

   There are only 8 colors by default but 10 available digits.  The last
two digits are left up to the user.  *note Behind The Scenes Look At
Colors:: for information on customizing colors.

* Menu:

* Behind The Scenes Look At Colors::


File: stumpwm.info,  Node: Behind The Scenes Look At Colors,  Prev: Colors,  Up: Colors

14.1 Behind The Scenes Look At Colors
=====================================

Color indexes are stored in *COLORS* as a list.  The default list of
colors leave 2 slots for the user to choose.  If you’d like to use
‘Papaya Whip’ and ‘Dark Golden Rod 3’ you might eval the following:

     (setf *colors* (append *colors*
                            (list "PapayaWhip"
                                  "DarkGoldenRod3")))
     (update-color-map (current-screen))

   Of course, you can change all the colors if you like.

 -- Function: parse-color-string string
     Parse a color-coded string into a list of strings and color
     modifiers

   @ parse-color-string
 -- Function: uncolorify string
     Remove any color markup in STRING

   @ uncolorify
 -- Variable: *colors*
     Eight colors by default.  You can redefine these to whatever you
     like and then call (update-color-map).

 -- Function: update-color-map screen
     Read *colors* and cache their pixel colors for use when rendering
     colored text.

   @ update-color-map

15 Hooks
********

StumpWM exports a number of hooks you can use to add customizations;
like hooks in Emacs, you add to a hook with the ‘add-hook’ function.
For example:

     (stumpwm:add-hook 'stumpwm:*new-window-hook* 'my-new-window-custos)

   adds your ‘my-new-window-custos’ function to the list of functions
called when a new window appears.

 -- Macro: add-hook hook fn
     Add FUNCTION to the HOOK-VARIABLE.  For example, to display a
     message whenever you switch frames:

          (defun my-rad-fn (to-frame from-frame)
            (stumpwm:message "Mustard!"))

          (stumpwm:add-hook stumpwm:*focus-frame-hook* 'my-rad-fn)

 -- Macro: remove-hook hook fn
     Remove the specified function from the hook.

 -- Macro: remove-all-hooks hook
     Remove all functions from a hook

 -- Function: run-hook hook
     Call each function in HOOK.

   @ run-hook
 -- Function: run-hook-with-args hook &rest args
     Call each function in HOOK and pass args to it.

   @ run-hook-with-args

   The following hooks are available:

 -- Hook: *new-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is added to the window list.  This
     includes a genuinely new window as well as bringing a withdrawn
     window back into the window list.

 -- Hook: *destroy-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is destroyed or withdrawn.

 -- Hook: *focus-window-hook*
     A hook called when a window is given focus.  It is called with 2
     arguments: the current window and the last window (could be nil).

 -- Hook: *place-window-hook*
     A hook called whenever a window is placed by rule.  Arguments are
     window group and frame

 -- Hook: *start-hook*
     A hook called when stumpwm starts.

 -- Hook: *internal-loop-hook*
     A hook called inside stumpwm’s inner loop.

 -- Hook: *focus-frame-hook*
     A hook called when a frame is given focus.  The hook functions are
     called with 2 arguments: the current frame and the last frame.

 -- Hook: *new-frame-hook*
     A hook called when a new frame is created.  The hook is called with
     the frame as an argument.

 -- Hook: *message-hook*
     A hook called whenever stumpwm displays a message.  The hook
     function is passed any number of arguments.  Each argument is a
     line of text.

 -- Hook: *top-level-error-hook*

16 Modules
**********

A module is an ASDF system that adds additional functionality to
StumpWM. StumpWM searches for modules in the *DATA-DIR*‘/modules’
directory.  By default this is ‘~/.stumpwm.d/modules’.

   Officially supported modules exist in a separate repository within
the StumpWM organization on github.  You can install the latest copy by
issuing ‘make install-modules’ from StumpWM’s root source directory.
This will run:
     git clone git@github.com:stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib.git ~/.stumpwm.d/modules

 -- Command: load-module name
     Loads the contributed module with the given NAME.

 -- Function: list-modules
     Return a list of the available modules.

   @ list-modules
 -- Variable: *load-path*
     A list of paths in which modules can be found, by default it is
     populated by any asdf systems found in ‘*module-dir*’ set from the
     configure script when StumpWM was built, or later by the user using
     ‘add-to-load-path’

 -- Command: add-to-load-path path
     If ‘PATH’ is not in ‘*LOAD-PATH*’ add it, check if ‘PATH’ contains
     an asdf system, and if so add it to the central registry

 -- Function: init-load-path path
     Recursively builds a list of paths that contain modules, then add
     them to the load path.  This is called each time StumpWM starts
     with the argument ‘*module-dir*’

   @ init-load-path
 -- Function: find-module name
     nil

16.1 Writing Modules
====================

Make sure to read *note Hacking::.  If you are familiar with writing
lisp packages for ASDF then you can jump in and get started.  In either
case, quicklisp ships a ‘quickproject’ package that makes setting up a
new module very easy.  After installing quicklisp (see the README.md for
a link):

   We’re going to put our new module in the ‘modules/’ directory of
*DATA-DIR* so that it will be immediately loadable by StumpWM.

   First make the directory ‘new-module’, then from a REPL issue:
     (ql:quickload "quickproject")
     (quickproject:make-project #p"~/.stumpwm.d/modules/new-module" :depends-on '(stumpwm) :name "new-module")
   This will create:
       -rw-rw-r--  1 dave dave   68 Apr  6 19:38 package.lisp
       -rw-rw-r--  1 dave dave   53 Mar 16  2014 README.txt
       -rw-rw-r--  1 dave dave  271 Mar 16  2014 new-module.asd
       -rw-rw-r--  1 dave dave 1.8K Apr  6 17:51 new-module.lisp

   The file ‘new-module.lisp’ will contain the actual implementation of
your module.  ASDF requires two other files in order to understand how
to load and compile your module.  They are ‘new-module.asd’ and
‘package.lisp’.  In our example, ‘new-module.asd’ should contain:
     (asdf:defsystem #:new-module
       :serial t
       :description "Describe new-module here"
       :author "Anne N. O'Nymous"
       :license "GPLv3"
       :depends-on (#:stumpwm)
       :components ((:file "package")
                    (:file "new-module"))) ; any other files you make go here
   The ‘package.lisp’ will contain:
     (defpackage #:new-module
       (:use #:cl :stumpwm))
   With these two files defined, and the implementation written in
‘new-module.lisp’, you should be able to load your module.

   Before we load it, we have to add the path to our *LOAD-PATH*.  This
can be accomplished by running the following from a REPL:
     (stumpwm:add-to-load-path "~/.stumpwm.d/modules/new-module")
   You can also run this interactively with ‘C-t ;’, which is bound to
the ‘colon’ command.

   Because we’ve put our module in a sub-directory of the default
*MODULE-DIR*, it will automatically get added to the *LOAD-PATH* the
next time StumpWM starts.  If you choose to develop your module
somewhere else (e.g.  ‘~/quicklisp/local-projects’), then you’ll have
add
     (add-to-load-path "~/quicklisp/local-projects/new-module")
   to your ‘.stumpwmrc’.

   When you’ve finished writing your module, you can distribute it
however you see fit.  If it becomes very popular, or you would like the
StumpWM devs to maintain it (and they agree), you can have your module
merged with the stumpwm-contrib repository on github, just open a pull
request to start the discussion.

17.1 Hacking: General Advice
============================

  1. Pay attention to file names and contents.  If you’re making changes
     to mode-line related code, don’t put it in ‘core.lisp’.  If you’re
     introducing some completely new featureset, consider putting all of
     the new code in a new file.

  2. Does a command need to be user-visible (“interactive”) or is it
     just called by other commands?

        • If it’s not going to be user-visible, you can just use the
          familiar ‘(defun foo () ...)’ syntax.

        • If you want the command to be used interactively, you use
          StumpWM’s ‘defcommand’ syntax, as in the examples below.

               (defcommand test (foo bar)
                  ((:string "How you're going to prompt for variable foo: ")
                   (:number "How you want to prompt for variable bar: "))
                  "This command is a test"
                  (body...))

               (defcommand test2 () ()
                  "This is also a test"
                  (body...))

               (defcommand title (args) (interactive-args)
                  "Doc string"
                  (body...))

          So basically, inside the first set of parentheses after the
          function name, you specify what (if any) arguments will be
          passed to the command.  The second set of parentheses tells
          StumpWM how to get those arguments if they’re not explicitly
          passed to the command.  For example,

               ((:string "What do you want to do: "))

          will read a string from the input the user provides.  The
          quoted text is the prompt the user will see.  Of course, if
          you were to, say, call the command test, as defined above,
          from another piece of code, it wouldn’t give the prompt as
          long as you fed it arguments.

  3. Note that all commands defined using the ‘defcommand’ syntax are
     available both to be called with ‘C-t ;’ and from within other lisp
     programs, as though they had been defun-ned (which, in fact, they
     have).

  4. Any code that depends on external libraries or programs that some
     users might not have installed should be packaged as a module and
     placed in the ‘*data-dir*/modules/’ directory.

  5. Don’t be afraid to submit your patches to the StumpWM mailing list!
     It may not immediately make it into the official git repository,
     but individual users might find it useful and apply it to their own
     setup, or might be willing to offer suggestions on how to improve
     the code.

17.2 Hacking: Adding Documentation and Editing This Manual
==========================================================

The manual is written in ‘texinfo’, so you may want to read that manual.
The ‘stumpwm.texi.in’ is processed by StumpWM with some additional
markup in the form of three letter character entries at the beginning of
a line.  ‘@@@ function’ defines functions, ‘%%% some-macro’ expands to
that macro and its docstring, etc.  Contributors are strongly encouraged
to add these items to this manual whenever something new is defined in a
patch.  You can test if your texinfo edits are valid by generating them
with ‘make stumpwm.info’, and viewing the new ‘stumpwm.info’ with ‘info
-f /path/to/stumpwm.info’, or ‘make stumpwm.texi’ for the raw stuff.

17.3 Hacking: Using git with StumpWM
====================================

For quite a while now, StumpWM has been using the git version control
system for development.  If you’re using one of the official releases,
you can get the bleeding-edge source code from the official git
repository with a single command:

     $ git clone git@github.com:stumpwm/stumpwm.git

   After this, you’ll have a complete git repository, along with the
complete revision history since the switch.  Feel free to play around;
git has some important features that actually make this safe!

   Before we get to that stuff, though, you’re going to want to tell git
about yourself so that your information is included in your commits and
patches.  The very minimum you’re going to want to do is:

     $ git config --global user.name "Anne N. O'Nymous"
     $ git config --global user.email "anonymous@foo.org"

   Be sure to check out the manual for ‘git-config’–there are several
options you might want to set, such as enabling colorized output or
changing the editor and pager you use when making commits and viewing
logs.

   For the sake of argument, let’s say you want to make some major
changes to both ‘user.lisp’ and ‘core.lisp’, add a file called
‘DANGEROUS_EXPERIMENT_DO_NOT_USE_OR_ELSE.lisp’, and remove the manual
because you’re too 1337 for such things.  However, you don’t want to
break your entire StumpWM setup and start over.  Thankfully, you don’t
have to.  Before you get started, issue this command from the StumpWM
source directory:

     $ git checkout -b experimental

   You should now find yourself in a new branch, called experimental.
To confirm this, type ‘git branch’; there should be an asterisk next to
the branch you’re currently viewing.  At any time, you can type ‘git
checkout master’ to return to your master branch, and at any time you
can have as many branches of the project as you like.  If you want to
create a new branch based not on the master branch but on your
experimental branch, for example, you’d type:

     $ git checkout -b new-experiment experimental

   This will place you in a newly-created branch called “new-experiment”
which should be identical to your experimental branch as of the last
commit (more on that soon).  If you’re actually typing out the
directions, switch back to your old experimental branch like so:

     $ git checkout experimental

   Anyway, now that you have a new branch, create that new file with the
long name, which we’ll just call ‘danger.lisp’ for brevity.  Make
whatever changes you want to it, and when you’re done, tell git about
your new file.

     $ git add dangerous.lisp

   Now, let’s pretend you’re done making changes.  Tell git you’re done
for now:

     $ git commit

   This will open up a prompt in your editor of choice for you to
describe your changes.  Try to keep the first line short, and then add
more explanation underneath (for an example, run the command ‘git log’
and take a look at some of the longer commit explanations).  Save that
file and then do this:

     $ git checkout master
     $ ls

   Then look for your new file.  It’s not there!  That’s because you’ve
done all of your work in another branch, which git is currently hiding
from you so that you can “check out” the branch called “master.” All is
as it should be—your master repository is still safe.

     $ git checkout experimental

   Now, delete ‘manual.lisp’ and ‘stumpwm.texi’.  That’s right.  Wipe
them off the face of the Earth, or at least off the hard drive of your
computer.  When you’re done, you don’t have to tell git you’ve deleted
them; it’ll figure it out on its own (though things may not compile
properly unless you edit ‘Makefile.in’ and ‘stumpwm.asd’.  Anyway, go
ahead and edit ‘core.lisp’ and ‘user.lisp’.  Really break ’em.  Run
free!  When you’re done, do another commit, as above, and give it a
stupid title like “lolz i b0rked stUmpwm guys wTF!?!?!!111!” Now try to
compile.  Just try.  It won’t work.  If it does, you’re some kind of
savant or something.  Keep up the good work.  If you’ve actually managed
to break StumpWM like you were supposed to, never fear!  You have two
options at this point.

   One is to go back to the master branch (with another git checkout)
and just delete your experimental branch, like so:

     $ git branch -D

   The “‘-D’” means to force a delete, even if the changes you’ve made
aren’t available elsewhere.  A “‘-d’” means to delete the branch if and
only if you’ve merged the changes in elsewhere.

   The other option is to create patches for each of your commits so
far, delete the branch, and then apply any working/wanted patches in a
new branch.  Create your patches (after committing) like so:

     $ git format-patch -o patches origin

   (Before doing that you can review your changes with ‘git log
origin..’)

   You can also use the ‘format-patch’ command to create a patch of
working code to send in to the mailing list.

   A developer might ask you to try out something they’re working on.
To fetch their master branch, you’d do this:

     $ git remote add -f -m master -t master foo git://bar.org/~foo/stumpwm

   Here, “foo” is the shorthand name you’ll use to refer to that
repository in the future.  To checkout a local copy of that repository,
you’d then do

     $ git checkout --track -b foo-master foo/master

   Later you could use ‘git pull foo’ to update while looking at that
branch (and note that ‘git pull’ with no arguments, in the master
branch, will update your StumpWM from the official repository).

   Finally, if you want to move your experimental changes into your
master branch, you’d checkout your master branch and run:

     $ git merge experimental

   If there are file conflicts, ‘git diff’ will show you where they are;
you have to fix them by hand.  When you’re done, do another

     $ git commit -a

   to finalize the changes to your master branch.  You can then delete
your experimental branch.  Alternately, you can wait until your changes
(assuming you sent them in) make it into the official repository before
deleting your experimental branch.

17.4 Sending Patches
====================

While patches are still welcome on the mailing list, StumpWM’s
development has mostly migrated to github’s issue tracker.  This means
you can open a pull request to submit a patch to StumpWM. The following
guidelines apply to pull requests and patches sent to the mailing list.

   • Make sure it applies clean to the main git repository

   • Ensure that you aren’t introducing tabs, extra blank lines, or
     whitespace at the end of lines.

   • Ensure your patch doesn’t contain irrelevant indenting or
     reformatting changes.

   • Try to make your patch address a single issue.  If your patch
     changes two unrelated issues, break them into two seperate patches
     that can stand on their own.

   • Don’t send intermediate patches.  When you’re working on a feature
     you might make several commits to your local repository as you
     refine it and work out the bugs.  When it’s polished and ready to
     ship, send it as one patch!  Sometimes it makes sense to send it as
     multiple patches if each patch contains a discrete feature or bug
     fix that can stand on its own.  If one of your patches changes code
     that was added or modified in an earlier patch, consider merging
     them together and sending them as one.

18 Advanced Configuration
*************************

 -- Variable: *default-package*
     This is the package eval reads and executes in.  You might want to
     set this to ‘:stumpwm’ if you find yourself using a lot of internal
     stumpwm symbols.  Setting this variable anywhere but in your rc
     file will have no effect.

 -- Variable: *default-bg-color*
     Default color for the desktop background.

 -- Function: run-commands &rest commands
     Run each stumpwm command in sequence.  This could be used if you’re
     used to ratpoison’s rc file and you just want to run commands or
     don’t know lisp very well.  One might put the following in one’s rc
     file:

          (stumpwm:run-commands
            "escape C-z"
            "exec firefox"
            "split")

   @ run-commands
 -- Variable: *startup-message*
     This is the message StumpWM displays when it starts.  Set it to NIL
     to suppress.

 -- Variable: *list-hidden-groups*
     Controls whether hidden groups are displayed by ’groups’ and
     ’vgroups’ commands

 -- Macro: defprogram-shortcut name &key (command (string-downcase
          (string name))) (props (quasiquote (quote (class #S(comma
          :expr (string-capitalize command) :kind 0))))) (map (quote
          *top-map*)) (key (quasiquote (kbd #S(comma :expr (concat H-
          (subseq command 0 1)) :kind 0)))) (pullp nil) (pull-name
          (intern1 (concat (string name) -PULL))) (pull-key (quasiquote
          (kbd #S(comma :expr (concat H-M- (subseq command 0 1)) :kind
          0))))
     Define a command and key binding to run or raise a program.  If
     PULLP is set, also define a command and key binding to run or pull
     the program.

 -- Variable: *initializing*
     True when starting stumpwm.  Use this variable in your rc file to
     run code that should only be executed once, when stumpwm starts up
     and loads the rc file.

 -- Command: loadrc
     Reload the ‘~/.stumpwmrc’ file.

 -- Variable: *ignore-wm-inc-hints*
     Set this to T if you never want windows to resize based on
     incremental WM_HINTs, like xterm and emacs.

 -- Variable: *max-last-message-size*
     how many previous messages to keep.

 -- Variable: *module-dir*
     The location of the contrib modules on your system.

 -- Function: set-module-dir dir
     Sets the location of the for StumpWM to find modules

   @ set-module-dir
 -- Variable: *mouse-focus-policy*
     The mouse focus policy decides how the mouse affects input focus.
     Possible values are :ignore, :sloppy, and :click.  :ignore means
     stumpwm ignores the mouse.  :sloppy means input focus follows the
     mouse; the window that the mouse is in gets the focus.  :click
     means input focus is transfered to the window you click on.

 -- Variable: *resize-hides-windows*
     Set to T to hide windows during interactive resize

 -- Variable: *root-click-focuses-frame*
     Set to NIL if you don’t want clicking the root window to focus the
     frame containing the pointer.

 -- Variable: *suppress-frame-indicator*
     Set this to T if you never want to see the frame indicator.

 -- Variable: *suppress-window-placement-indicator*
     Set to T if you never want to see messages that windows were placed
     according to rules.

 -- Variable: *text-color*
     The color of message text.

 -- Variable: *timeout-frame-indicator-wait*
     The amount of time a frame indicator timeout takes.

 -- Variable: *top-level-error-action*
     If an error is encountered at the top level, in
     STUMPWM-INTERNAL-LOOP, then this variable decides what action shall
     be taken.  By default it will print a message to the screen and to
     *standard-output*.

     Valid values are :message, :break, :abort.  :break will break to
     the debugger.  This can be problematic because if the user hit’s a
     mapped key the ENTIRE keyboard will be frozen and you will have to
     login remotely to regain control.  :abort quits stumpwm.
